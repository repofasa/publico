And there are many other things that they have traditionally observed, the purification of cups and jugs and kettles and beds.)<br />So the Pharisees and scribes questioned him, \"Why do your disciples not follow the tradition of the elders but instead eat a meal with unclean hands?\"<br />He responded, \"Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me;<br />In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines human precepts.'<br />You disregard God's commandment but cling to human tradition.\"<br />He summoned the crowd again and said to them, \"Hear me, all of you, and understand.<br />Nothing that enters one from outside can defile that person; but the things that come out from within are what defile.\"<br />From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder,<br />adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly.<br />All these evils come from within and they defile.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Giles of Castaneda(Abbot (640-720))</h3><p>SAINT GILESAbbot(640-720) St. Giles is venerated in France and England. He was said to be an Athenian noble. His piety and learning drew admirers, and thus he sought holy solitude. With docility to the Holy Spirit, Giles sailed to France and made a hermitage in the open deserts near the mouth of the Rhone. He afterward transferred to a site near the river Gard and settled in a forest in the diocese of Nismes. He lived for many years conversing only with God and the saints. Miraculously, he was nourished by a hind who gave him its milk. Once, when the animal was being hunted, it fled to Giles for refuge, who was thus discovered. The miracles attributed to Giles' intercession made his name ring throughout France. He was even esteemed by the French king: the latter failed at making Giles renounce solitude. Giles later admitted disciples and founded a monastery. In the following ages, his monastery became a flourishing abbey of the Benedictine Order.</p>"

By divine providence, Gregory saw Anglo-Saxon slaves at a market. A longing to convert them was enkindled in his heart. He set out for Deira and began converting a nation that ended slavery in the 1800s. The pope appointed Gregory as one of the seven deacons of Rome. He served faithfully as Nuncio to the imperial court in Constantinople for many years. Although apart from Britain, Gregory never forgot his inspiration to convert the Angles. After becoming pope, he sent St. Augustine and other monks to evangelize Britain. For fourteen years, Pope Gregory raised the Church and Western Civilization on his shoulders. He healed schisms, revived discipline, saved Italy by converting the wild Arian Lombards, aided in the conversion of the Spanish and French Goths and kindled the light of Faith in Britain. He is honored as one of the four great doctors of the Church.</p>"

When he was 19, he was granted a vision of the Eternal Wisdom. All earthly things paled before this sight; and as it faded away, a void was left that no one except God could fill. Refusing the offer of a brilliant marriage, he fled secretly from his home in Venice and joined the Canons Regular of St. George. One by one, Lawrence disciplined his natural instincts that could bar his union with God. When a nobleman once chided him for sacrificing earthly prospects, he pointed out the shortness of life, the temporality of earthly pleasures and the greatness of the prize he was seeking. The nobleman was speechless: He went on to leave the world and joined Lawrence as a fellow-disciple and novitiate. The nobleman's holy death bore every mark that he secured eternal life. As superior and general, Lawrence enlarged and strengthened his Order. As bishop, he thoroughly reformed his see. His zealousness led to him to be appointed as the first patriarch of Venice, but he remained ever in heart and soul a humble priest thirsting for the sight of heaven. At length, the eternal vision began to dawn. \"Are you laying a bed of feathers for me?Not so. My Lord was stretched on a hard and painful tree.\" Laid upon straw, he exclaimed in rapture, \"Good Jesus, behold I come.\" He passed away at 74 years old in 1455.</p><hr /><h3>St. Teresa of Calcutta(Foundress (1910-1997))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910-1997)“By blood, I am Albanian. By citizenship, an Indian. By faith, I am a Catholic nun. As to my calling, I belong to the world. As to my heart, I belong entirely to the Heart of Jesus.” Small of stature, rocklike in faith, Mother Teresa of Calcutta proclaimed God’s love of humanity, especially for the poorest of the poor. “God still loves the world and He sends you and me to be His love and His compassion to the poor.”Her soul filled with the grace of Christ; and she burned with one desire: “to quench His thirst for love and for souls.” She was born on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, a city at the crossroads of Balkan history. She was the youngest child of Nikola and Drane Bojaxhiu. She was baptised Gonxha Agnes, received First Communion at the age of 5 and was confirmed in November 1916. Following her First Holy Communion, a love for souls was kindled within her. Her father’s sudden death when she was 8 left the family in financial straits. Drane raised her children firmly and lovingly, which greatly influenced her daughter’s character and vocation. Gonxha’s religious formation was further assisted by the vibrant Jesuit parish of the Sacred Heart where she was much involved. At the age of 18, moved by a desire to become a missionary, Gonxha left her home in September 1928 to join the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary, known as the Sisters of Loreto, in Ireland. There, she received the name Sister Mary Teresa, after St. Thérèse of Lisieux. In December, she departed for India and arrived in Calcutta on January 6, 1929. After making her First Profession of Vows in May 1931, Sister Teresa was assigned to the Loreto Entally community in Calcutta and taught at St. Mary’s School for girls. On May 24, 1937, Sister Teresa made her Final Profession of Vows, becoming, as she said, the “spouse of Jesus” for “all eternity.” From that time on, she was called Mother Teresa. She continued teaching at St. Mary’s and in 1944 became the school’s principal. A person of profound prayer and deep love for her religious sisters and students, Mother Teresa’s twenty years in Loreto were filled with profound happiness. Noted for her charity, unselfishness and courage, her capacity for hard work and a natural talent for organization, she lived out her consecration to Jesus in the midst of her companions with fidelity and joy. On September 10, 1946, during the train ride from Calcutta to Darjeeling for her annual retreat, Mother Teresa received her “inspiration,” her “call within a call.” On that day, in a way she would never explain, Jesus’ thirst for love and for souls took hold of her heart and the desire to satiate His thirst became the driving force of her life. Over the course of the next weeks and months, by means of interior locutions and visions, Jesus revealed to her the desire of His heart for “victims of love” who would “radiate His love on souls.” “Come be My light,” He begged her. “I cannot go alone.” He revealed His pain at the neglect of the poor, His sorrow at their ignorance of Him and His longing for their love. He asked Mother Teresa to establish a religious community, Missionaries of Charity, dedicated to the service of the poorest of the poor. Nearly two years of testing and discernment passed before Mother Teresa received permission to begin. On August 17, 1948, she dressed for the first time in a white, blue-bordered sari and passed through the gates of her beloved Loreto convent to enter the world of the poor. After a short course with the Medical Mission Sisters in Patna, Mother Teresa returned to Calcutta and found temporary lodging with the Little Sisters of the Poor. On December 21, she went for the first time to the slums. She visited families, washed the sores of some children, cared for an old man lying sick on the road and nursed a woman dying of hunger and TB. She started each day in communion with Jesus in the Eucharist and then went out, rosary in her hand, to find and serve Him in “the unwanted, the unloved, the uncared for.” After some months, she was joined, one by one, by her former students. On October 7, 1950, the new congregation of the Missionaries of Charity was officially established in the Archdiocese of Calcutta. By the early 1960s, Mother Teresa began to send her Sisters to other parts of India. The Decree of Praise granted to the Congregation by Pope Paul VI in February 1965 encouraged her to open a house in Venezuela. It was soon followed by foundations in Rome and Tanzania and, eventually, on every continent. Starting in 1980 and continuing through the 1990s, Mother Teresa opened houses in almost all of the communist countries, including the former Soviet Union, Albania and Cuba. In order to respond better to both the physical and spiritual needs of the poor, Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity Brothers in 1963, in 1976 the contemplative branch of the Sisters, in 1979 the Contemplative Brothers, and in 1984 the Missionaries of Charity Fathers. Yet her inspiration was not limited to those with religious vocations. She formed the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa as well as the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, which comprises people of many faiths and nationalities. The Workers' spirit of prayer, simplicity, sacrifice and works of love later inspired the Lay Missionaries of Charity. In answer to the requests of many priests, Mother Teresa also began the Corpus Christi Movement in 1981 as a “little way of holiness” for those who desire to share in her charism and spirit. During the years of rapid growth, the world began to turn its eyes towards Mother Teresa and the work she had started. Numerous awards, beginning with the Indian Padmashri Award in 1962 and notably the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, honored her work, while an increasingly interested media began to follow her activities. She received both prizes and attention “for the glory of God and in the name of the poor.” The whole of Mother Teresa’s life and labor bore witness to the joy of loving, the greatness and dignity of every human person, the value of little things done faithfully and with love, and the surpassing worth of friendship with God. But there was another heroic side of this great woman that was revealed only after her death. Hidden from all eyes, hidden even from those closest to her, was her interior life marked by an experience of a deep, painful and abiding feeling of being separated from God, even rejected by Him, along with an ever-increasing longing for His love. She called her inner experience, “the darkness.”The “painful night” of her soul, which began around the time she started her work for the poor and continued to the end of her life, led her to an ever more profound union with God. Through the darkness, she mystically participated in the thirst of Jesus, in His painful and burning longing for love, and in the interior desolation of the poor. During the last years of her life, despite increasingly severe health problems, Mother Teresa continued to govern her Society and respond to the needs of the poor and the Church. By 1997, Mother Teresa’s Sisters numbered nearly 4,000 members and were established in 610 foundations, in 123 countries. In March 1997, she blessed her newly-elected successor as Superior General of the Missionaries of Charity and then made one more trip abroad. After meeting Pope John Paul II for the last time, she returned to Calcutta and spent her final weeks receiving visitors and instructing her Sisters. On September 5, Mother Teresa’s earthly life came to an end. She was given the honor of a state funeral by the government of India and her body was buried in the Mother House of the Missionaries of Charity. Her tomb quickly became a place of pilgrimage and prayer for people of all faiths, rich and poor alike. Mother Teresa left a testament of unshakable faith, invincible hope and extraordinary charity. Her response to Jesus’ plea, “Come be My light,” made her a Missionary of Charity, a “mother to the poor,” a symbol of compassion to the world, and a living witness to the thirsting love of God. Less than two years after her death, in view of Mother Teresa’s widespread reputation of holiness and the favors being reported, Pope John Paul II permitted the opening of her Cause of Canonization. On December 20, 2002, he approved the decrees of her heroic virtues and miracles. Mother Teresa was canonized on September 4, 2016, by Pope Francis.</p><hr /><h3>St. Bertin()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

He was consecrated abbot of St. Mark's near Spoleto. He was favored with the gift of miracles. Ab. Eleutherius once delivered a child from demonic possession. However, the demon reentered when Ab. Eleutherius said, \"The devil dares not approach him since he is among the servants of God.\" The child was finally delivered when Ab. Eleutherius confessed, prayed and fasted with his community. When St. Gregory the Great was unable to fast on Easter Eve because of extreme weakness, he entreated Ab. Eleutherius to go with him to the church of St. Andrew and pray. Ab. Eleutherius prayed with childlike confidence, and the Pope found himself suddenly strengthened and able to perform the fast. According to St. Gregory the Great, Ab. Eleutherius raised a dead man to life. The latter passed away in Rome, at St. Andrew's monastery, around the year 585. His compunction for sins reflects his sincerity and complete trust in God's mercy: rising immediately after every fall.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Bertrand()</h3><hr />"

He was the son of Chlodomir, the king of Orleans, and the grandson of St. Clotilda. He was scarce three years old when his father was killed in Burgundy. St. Clotilda raised him and his two brothers in Paris. Cloud's ambitious uncles divided the kingdom of Orleans among themselves and killed Cloud's brothers. By divine providence, Cloud escaped and was given sanctuary by the bishop of Rheims. His spiritual director was the hermit St. Severinus. He later renounced the world and served God in a monastic state. Cloud wished to live unknown to the world and later withdrew to Provence. When his hermitage was discovered, he returned to Paris and received holy orders at the request of Parisians. He was ordained a priest in 551 by Eusebius, the bishop of Paris. Fr. Cloud served villagers near Paris for several years. He built a church in western Paris dedicated to St. Martin of Tours. The sanctuary he created led the commune to be named after him. He instructed and edified his countrymen until he passed away in 560.</p><hr /><h3>St. Regina()</h3><hr />"

After being ordained in New Granada, Peter was sent to Cartagena, the great slave market of the West Indies. For more than forty years, he labored in this work - calling himself \"the slave of the slaves.\" He was their apostle, father, physician and friend. He fed them, nursed them and tended to their sores. His cloak, though stained, emitted a miraculous perfume. He immediately revived whenever a slave ship docked and he was at once on-board bringing comfort of body and soul. A false charge of reiterating baptism stopped his work for a while. He submitted without a murmur until the calumny was refuted. God so blessed St. Peter's ministry that 40,000 were baptized before he passed away in 1654.</p>"

He was one of the confessors who, under the tyrant Maximin Daia, lost his right eye and was enslaved in the mines. When peace was restored, Bp. Paphnutius returned to his flock. The Arian heresy was dividing the Church, so Bp. Paphnutius arose to defend it. As a confessor (one who had confessed the Faith under torments), he was highly regarded at the great Council of Nice. Constantine the Great conferred privately with the Bishop and reverently kissed the place where the latter had lost an eye. Bp. Paphnutius remained in contact with St. Athanasius. He accompanied the latter to the Council of Tyre in 335 where they found the greater part of the assembly to be professed Arians. Seeing Maximus, the bishop of Jerusalem, among the Arians, Bp. Paphnutius took him aside and said that no one who bore the same marks as he did should be cowed or affected by those who deny Christianity's fundamental article. We have no particular account of Bp. Paphnutius' death, but his name is in the Roman Martyrology on September 11.</p><hr /><h3>Sts.

He eventually left his home in Brussels and sought poverty and union with God. He arrived in Laeken, near Brussels, and showed such devotion before Our Lady's shrine that a priest besought him to stay and serve the Church. Thenceforth, Guy's great joy was to be in the church: sweeping the floor and ceiling, polishing the altars and cleansing the sacred vessels. By day, he made time to befriend the poor; and his almsgiving became renowned. When a merchant of Brussels heard of this Sacristan's generosity, he came to Laeken and offered Guy a share in his business. Guy was reluctant to leave the church, but the offer seemed providential; and he closed with it at last. However, the ship was lost on its first voyage. Upon returning, Guy found his place at the church filled. The rest of his life was spent fasting, praying and almsgiving. Around the year 1012, when his life drew to a close, Guy returned to Anderlecht. A light shone around him as he passed away and a holy voice was heard proclaiming his eternal reward.</p>"

John's title, \"Chrysostom\" means \"Golden-mouthed.\" He was a zealous reformer whose activism provoked retaliation from rent-seeking politicians. St. John was born in Antioch and received formation from his mother. Early on, he decided to pursue a religious vocation. He was first a monk who practiced asceticism, but later became a preacher and clergyman. As a zealous priest and later the bishop of Antioch, John preached social equity, care for the poor and the rejection of materialism and consumerism. Faithful to both the State and the Church, he once turned citizens away from rioting. Bp. John's faithfulness eventually saw him consecrated archbishop of Constantinople. However, his denunciation of ecclesiastical abuses provoked the wrath of high-ranking officials, including churchmen and the empress. The rancor of his enemies exploded into unjust, formal proceedings, which resulted in his banishment, exile and death. 50 years later, his memory reconciled the different factions in cities where he preached. Today, St. John Chrysostom is remembered for his scintillating preaching, authentic application of the Gospel and perfect integrity. He stands at the side of Jesus Christ, interceding in causes of preaching and good works. As a disciple, St. John Chrysostom followed in the footsteps of our Lord, leading captives to freedom in his train (Ps. 68:18).</p><hr /><h3>St. Eulogius(Bishop)</h3><hr />"

Or do you show contempt for the church of God and make those who have nothing feel ashamed? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you?

Cyprian regrouped outside his episcopal city. He later returned to serve parishioners during a plague. Afterward, he was banished and saw a vision of his martyrdom. After being recalled from exile, Bp. Cyprian received capital punishment. He said, \"Thanks be to God\" on the occasion of his sentencing.He was beheaded before a crowd of Christians on September 14, 258. The pagan authorities respectfully allowed his burial.God our Father, in Saints Cornelius and Cyprian you have given your people an inspiring example of dedication to the pastoral ministry and constant witness to Christ in their suffering. May their prayers and faith give us courage to work for the unity of our Church.

His position at the royal court came about thanks to his preaching and reforms. After Thomas received a religious habit from the order of St. Augustine, he gained a reputation as a powerful and effective preacher. His brilliance led to a promotion as King Charles V's consultant. In this capacity, he denounced ecclesiastical abuses and held churchmen accountable. He also sent Augustinian missionaries to Mexico. For his brilliance and humility, he was highly favored by Spanish royalty. Thomas accepted the Archbishopric of Valencia upon the order of his superiors. The promotion made no change to his ascetic lifestyle and he continued wearing the monastic habit. He received and housed the poor at his residence and gave the money used for refurnishing it to construct a public hospital. Meanwhile, he established an administrative system to unify different parishes, founded orphanages and schools and improved conditions in Spain's penal system. He did everything for Jesus Christ with trust and devotion in Mother Mary. St. Thomas was the only poor person in his parish by the time he passed away. He distributed the remainder of his personal belongings beforehand.

He was awkward, stumbling in conversation and difficult to teach. His wonderment at God's creation and the sight of God that took his mind were misunderstood by many, which did not help his case among religious. He is venerated as a mystic and a saint. Joseph grew up in poverty and without a father. He was so socially difficult and unlearned that he was expelled from theFriars Minor Conventual at the convent of Grotella. He was only readmitted as a caretaker at their stable. God never abandoned Joseph and gave His servant grace to be joyful in the simplest, most basic tasks and responsibilities. Joseph was finally ordained a priest when the only question on his examination was about the one Scripture passage he could discourse on eloquently. Fr. Joseph had command over beasts and nature like his predecessor St. Francis. He only occasionally ate solid foods and subsisted on the bare minimum. For his brothers, he begged for food and found success in this capacity; although he would get berated for losing a piece of his garment, which the poor has taken for keepsakes. Fr. Joseph was transferred to different convents by the Inquisition, who suspected him for his ecstasies, levitations and command over animals. However, no fault was found in him. Although being transferred to avoid public awareness, devotees and pilgrims sought him out. His simplicity and selflessness were remarkable, and these often gave him away. In his final test, Fr. Joseph was afflicted with sickness. He regained the old joy and laughter from his early years through the help of one attending him in his final moments. His simplicity was the perfect mirror of God; the grace accompanying him testified to the presence of God; and he beholds in Heaven forever the God whom he beheld and served during his journey though time.</p>"

In a vision, St. Januarius saw Sosius' head girt with flames. The Bishop took it as a portend of martyrdom. Before long, Sosius was arrested and cast into prison. St. Januarius visited him, but was also arrested after some time. Following a Roman examination, Sosius and St. Januarius were sentenced to be devoured by lions at the amphitheater. The animals, however, did not harm them. The governor of Campania then had them beheaded. St. Januarius' relics are venerated in the Naples Cathedral.

One day while hunting, he saw between the horns of a stag the image of our crucified Savior. In response to what he considered a voice from heaven, or a conscience convicted by Jesus, he received baptism. Although Christians were facing persecution, Eustachius would not deny Jesus. Eventually, he lost his possessions and his rank. His wife and children were also taken away. Nonetheless, he remained steadfast. Reduced to abject poverty, Eustachius became the servant of a rich land-owner and tended the latter's fields. Meanwhile, the Roman population was being trampled by barbarian hordes. In desperation, Emperor Trajan sought out Eustachius and placed him in command of troops sent to fight the enemy. During the campaign, Eustachius found his wife and children. Eustachius triumphantly returned to Rome decorated with honors. However, Trajan demanded that he offer pagan sacrifice. He steadfastly refused; and was thrown together with his wife and children to two starving lions. Instead of harming them, the lions frolicked around them. With a deadened conscience, Trajan ordered the family to be burned to death inside a bronze bull. Eustachius and his family were martyred for their living faith. They reign with Jesus Christ and Mother Mary forever. They receive our prayers for intercession and give them to God with perfect humility.</p>"

Jesus said to him, \"Follow me.\" Leaving everything, Matthew arose and followed Jesus. The Jews resented publicans as traitors to the nation and Pharisees would not sit with them. Jesus radically called those who were ostracized. Recognizing in Jesus the Messiah, St. Matthew made a great feast and invited a number of sinners and tax collectors. The Pharisees in attendance were scandalized and questioned why Jesus dialogued with sinners. Jesus replied, \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice.' For I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners\" (Mt. 9:12). After the Ascension, St. Matthew remained some years in Judæa. He wrote his gospel to teach his countrymen that Jesus is the Messiah. He then preached far and wide, and is said to have finished his course in Ethiopia, where he was martyred. Obey all inspirations of Our Lord as promptly as St. Matthew, who, at a single word, says St. Bridget, \"Laid down the heavy burden of the world to put on the light and sweet yoke of Christ.\"</p>"

They were encamped near Lake Geneva, under the Emperor Maximian, when they were ordered to butcher the Christian population. They refused, and as punishment were decimated. St. Maurice, the chief captain of the legion, encouraged his men to persevere and follow their comrades to heaven. Alban Butler quotes him saying, \"In all things, we readily obey, but we cannot stain our hands with innocent blood. ... We would rather die without shame than live by sin.\" While the massacre dragged on, the Theban martyrs generously flung down their arms and offered their necks to the sword. Jesus was undoubtedly praying for them; and the words in Scripture ring true: \"For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his\" (Romans 6:5).</p>"

Like the Apostle Paul, Padre Pio da Pietrelcina placed the Holy Cross at the center of his life and apostolic work. In the Cross, he became like the Holy One: a victim, a sacrifice, the expiation of sin. In emulating the Crucified Christ, he could have said: \"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me\" (Gal 2:20). Serving those who came to him in ever greater numbers, he was the spiritual father of an immense number of sons and daughters. St. Pio was the son of Grazio Forgione and Maria Giuseppa De Nunzio. He was born on May 25, 1887, in Pietrelcina, in the Archdiocese of Benevento. He was baptized the next day and named Francesco. At the age of 12, Francesco received the Sacrament of Confirmation and made his First Holy Communion. On January 6, 1903, at the age of 16, he entered the novitiate of the Capuchin Friars in Morcone. On January 22, he took the Franciscan habit and the name Brother Pio. At the end of his novitiate year, he took simple vows. He made his solemn profession on January 27, 1907, and he was ordained a priest on August 10, 1910. He stayed at home with his family until 1916 because of ill health. That September, he was sent to the friary of San Giovanni Rotondo. The Holy Spirit spoke through Padre Pio in the sacrament of reconciliation and the celebration of the Eucharist. The graces people received were thanks to his priestly ministry. He spent the day and a large part of the night in conversation with God. He would say: \"In books we seek God, in prayer we find him. Prayer is the key which opens God's heart.\" With heroic prudence, Padre Pio spoke inconvenient truths to those who sought his counsel. During the Sacrament of Reconciliation, he sometimes read the hearts of men. He was so effective in this ministry that Satan would manifest and attempt to frighten him. Padre Pio was unmoved by demonic manifestion, and placed his trust in God and prayed even while experiencing complete darkness. His concern was the glory of God and the good of souls. He treated everyone with justice, frankness and great respect. For more than fifty years, he welcomed countless people who had recourse to his ministry and his confessional; his counsel and his consolation. He was almost beseiged. They sought him in church, in the sacristy and in the friary. He gave himself to everyone, rekindling faith, dispensing grace and bringing light. But especially in the poor, the suffering and the sick, he saw the image of Christ, and he gave himself particularly to them. On May 5, 1956, he founded the Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza (House for the Relief of Suffering). Padre Pio understood very early in life that his would be the way of the Cross, and he accepted it at once with courage and love. For many years, he experienced spiritual suffering. For years, he endured the pains of his wounds with admirable serenity.When he had to submit to investigations and restrictions in his priestly ministry, he accepted everything with profound humility and resignation. In the face of unjust accusations and calumnies, he remained silent, trusting always in the judgement of God, of his immediate superiors and of his own conscience. Padre Pio mortified his senses and was temperate in his attitude and in his way of life. He always obeyed the commands of his superiors even when they were burdensome. His obedience was supernatural in intention, universal in its scope and complete in its execution. He lived the spirit of poverty with total detachment from self, from earthly goods, from his own comfort and from honors. With great love for the virtue of chastity, his behavior was modest in all situations and with all people.He sincerely thought of himself as small, weak and infirm, and yet carried God's gifts obediently: like the donkey that carried Jesus into Jerusalem (St. Jose Maria Escriva). Amid so much admiration around him, he would say: \"I only want to be a poor friar who prays.\" From his youth, Padre Pio's health was not very robust, and it declined rapidly in the last years of his life. Sister Death took him well-prepared and serene on September 23, 1968, at the age of 81. An extraordinary gathering of people attended his funeral. On February 20, 1971, barely three years after his passing, Pope Paul VI, speaking to the Superiors of the Capuchin Order, said of him: \"Look what fame he had, what a worldwide following gathered around him! But why? Perhaps because he was a philosopher? Because he was wise? Because he had resources at his disposal? It is because he said Mass humbly, heard confessions from dawn to dusk and was - it is not easy to say it - one who bore the wounds of our Lord (stigmata). He was a man of prayer and suffering.\" In the years following his death, his reputation for sanctity and miracles grew steadily, and became established in the Church all over the world and among all kinds of people. (...) On May 2, 1999, in the course of a solemn concelebrated Mass in St. Peter's Square, Pope John Paul II beatified the Venerable Servant of God Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, naming September 23 as the date of his liturgical feast. (...)On December 20, in the presence of Pope John Paul II, the Decree on the miracle was promulgated. Finally, on February 28, 2002, the Decree of Canonization was promulgated.Homily at the canonization of St. Padre Pio of Pietrelcina (June 16, 2002)1. \"For my yoke is easy and my burden light\" (Mt 11: 30). Jesus' words to his disciples, which we just heard, help us to understand the most important message of this solemn celebration. Indeed, in a certain sense, we can consider them as a magnificent summary of the whole life of Padre Pio of Pietrelcina, today proclaimed a saint. The evangelical image of the \"yoke\" recalls the many trials that the humble Capuchin of San Giovanni Rotondo had to face. Today we contemplate in him how gentle the \"yoke\" of Christ is, and how truly light is his burden when it is borne with faithful love. The life and mission of Padre Pio prove that difficulties and sorrows, if accepted out of love, are transformed into a privileged way of holiness, which opens onto the horizons of a greater good, known only to the Lord. 2. \"But may I never boast except in the cross of Our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Gal 6,14). Is it not, precisely, the \"glory of the Cross\" that shines above all in Padre Pio? How timely is the spirituality of the Cross lived by the humble Capuchin of Pietrelcina. Our time needs to rediscover the value of the Cross in order to open the heart to hope. Throughout his life, he always sought greater conformity with the Crucified, since he was very conscious of having been called to collaborate in a special way in the work of redemption. His holiness cannot be understood without this constant reference to the Cross. In God's plan, the Cross constitutes the true instrument of salvation for the whole of humanity and the way clearly offered by the Lord to those who wish to follow him (cf. Mk 16,24). The Holy Franciscan of the Gargano understood this well, when on the Feast of the Assumption in 1914, he wrote: \"In order to succeed in reaching our ultimate end we must follow the divine Head, who does not wish to lead the chosen soul on any way other than the one he followed; by that, I say, of abnegation and the Cross\" (Epistolario II, p. 155). 3. \"I am the Lord who acts with mercy\" (Jer 9,23). Padre Pio was a generous dispenser of divine mercy, making himself available to all by welcoming them, by spiritual direction and, especially, by the administration of the sacrament of Penance. I also had the privilege, during my young years, of benefitting from his availability for penitents. The ministry of the confessional, which is one of the distinctive traits of his apostolate, attracted great crowds of the faithful to the monastery of San Giovanni Rotondo. Even when that unusual confessor treated pilgrims with apparent severity, the latter, becoming conscious of the gravity of sins and sincerely repentant, almost always came back for the peaceful embrace of sacramental forgiveness. May his example encourage priests to carry out with joy and zeal this ministry which is so important today (...). 4. \"You, Lord, are my only good\". This is what we sang in the responsorial psalm. Through these words, the new Saint invites us to place God above everything, to consider him our sole and highest good. In fact, the ultimate reason for the apostolic effectiveness of Padre Pio, the profound root of so much spiritual fruitfulness can be found in that intimate and constant union with God, attested to by his long hours spent in prayer and in the confessional. He loved to repeat, \"I am a poor Franciscan who prays\" convinced that \"prayer is the best weapon we have, a key that opens the heart of God\". This fundamental characteristic of his spirituality continues in the \"Prayer Groups\" that he founded, which offer to the Church and to society the wonderful contribution of incessant and confident prayer. To prayer, Padre Pio joined an intense charitable activity, of which the \"Home for the Relief of Suffering\" is an extraordinary expression. Prayer and charity, this is the most concrete synthesis of Padre Pio's teaching, which today is offered to everyone.5. \"I bless you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because ... these things ... you have revealed to little ones\" (Mt 11,25). How appropriate are these words of Jesus, when we think of them as applied to you, humble and beloved Padre Pio. Teach us, we ask you, humility of heart so we may be counted among the little ones of the Gospel, to whom the Father promised to reveal the mysteries of his Kingdom. Help us to pray without ceasing, certain that God knows what we need even before we ask him. Obtain for us the eyes of faith that will be able to recognize right away in thepoor andsuffering the face of Jesus. Sustain us in the hour of the combat and of the trial and, if we fall, make us experience the joy of the sacrament of forgiveness. Grant us your tender devotion to Mary, the Mother of Jesus and our Mother. Accompany us on our earthly pilgrimage toward the blessed homeland, where we hope to arrive in order to contemplate forever the glory of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.Amen.</p><hr /><h3>St. Thecla(Virgin & Martyr (1st century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT THECLA Virgin and Martyr(1st century) St. Thecla was born in 30 AD. In both great and small things, she relied on Jesus' will (Lk. 16:10, Mt. 10:39). She is honored in Eastern and Western traditions for her perfect love. St. Thecla encountered Jesus in Iconium, present day Turkey. She received the Holy Spirit while listening to St. Paul preach. To follow Jesus, she renounced her title and an arranged marriage to a Roman nobleman. In retaliation, secular authorities burned her at the stake. Miraculously, God rescued her. St. Thecla's apostolate with St. Paul converted the hearts of many (Lk. 2:35). She was arrested yet again and thrown to starving lions in the colosseum. Miraculously, the lions did not harm her and she escaped her captors. St. Thecla went on to preach with St. Paul and lived happily. She became a healer and doctor of souls. Her memory is celebrated in churches throughout Turkey and Syria.</p><hr /><h3>St. Constantius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

He carried the French Church on his shoulders. He instituted safety nets for the poor and modern seminaries during the Reformation. His Daughters of Charity are sent to serve the poor to this very day. St. Vincent tended his father's pigs during childhood. By the time he was 32, he was the private tutor of France's most illustrious family, the De Gondi. They supported his ministry among French convicts and his construction of a hospital to succor their needs. This ministry in Paris was replicated in Marseilles and Bordeaux. St. Vincent organized conferences on De Gondi estates, which assisted the poor until the French Revolution. He also established the Congregation of the Missions to minister to the rural poor, which led to a reform in priestly ordination. At 48 years old, St. Vincent found himself leading a movement that extended the vetting period for candidates to the priesthood from weeks to years. He also founded seminaries that gave churchmen knowledgeable about philosophy. St. Vincent founded the Daughters of Charity and the Ladies of Charity, which enable women to assist the poor and orphans. Since their beginning in 1629, the Sisters raised money to construct hospitals, shelters and orphanages. They staffed projects that assisted tens-of-thousands of homeless and poor through shelters, orphanages and vocational training. During the Thirty Years' War, the Sisters sheltered and fed the displaced and vulnerable daily. St. Vincent once said, \"Turn the medal and you will see Jesus Christ.\" St. Vincent strove to protect the Church against heresy, supported congregations stressed by war and ransomed Christians enslaved by Turks. He was the trusted confidant of rulers who supported his relief of the poor; yet he not once profited personally. St. Vincent championed Jesus Christ; served Jesus Christ and reflected Jesus to all whom he encountered. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is one of the widest-reaching nonprofits that serve the poor, while his Congregations are active and support the Church to this very day.</p>"

The Son of Man is to be handed over to men.\"<br />But they did not understand this saying; its meaning was hidden from them so that they should not understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</p><hr /><h3>St. Simón de Rojas(O.SS. (1552-1624))</h3><p>Saint Simón de Rojas O.SS. (1552-1624) St. Simón de Rojas of the Trinitarian Order was born in Valladolid, Castilla, Spain, on October 28, 1552. At 12 years old, he entered the Trinitarian monastery. On October 28, 1572, he made his religious profession. St. Simón's mother was the virtuous Constanza. She nurtured his faith and devotion toward Mary. Constanza and Gregorio's veneration helped St. Simón pronounce his first words, \"Ave Maria.\" St. Simón's greatest joy was visiting Marian shrines, praying to Mary and acknowledging Her importance in the mystery of God and the Church. By praying the Rosary, he participated in Mary's mission to transmit grace through Jesus' life. St. Simón studied at the University of Salamanca from 1573 to 1579. He was ordained a priest in 1577. From 1581 to 1587, he taught philosophy and theology in Toledo. From 1588 until his death, he was the superior of various monasteries in his province. He was also sent twice as apostolic visitor to Castilla and once to Andalusia. St. Simón lived his religious vows while emulating the life of Mary. To become united with Mary's salvific role, he established the Congregation of the Slaves of Mary on April 14, 1612. The Order was for the glory of the Trinity, in praise of the Virgin, in the service of the poor. For him, to be a slave of Mary meant belonging totally to her, \"Totus tuus,\" in order to unite oneself more intimately to Christ. The Congregation was intended for the laity: persons of every social class could join. The members included the king and his children, honored Mary by giving maternal help to her favorite children: the poor. This work still continues in Spain. In 1619, St. Simón was appointed tutor to the royal princes of Spain. St. Simón is held to be one of the greatest contemplatives of his time. In his work, \"The Greatness of Prayer,\" he is a master-instructor of souls. In it, he emphasizes that the contemplative dimension joins to the active through works of mercy. Faithful to the Trinitarian charism, he promoted the ransom of captives, helped relieve the many needs of the poor, consoled the sick and assisted the marginalized. He accepted duties at Court only on condition that he continue his work with the poor, whom he helped in a thousand ways, always with a smile on his face and at any hour of the day or night. The expressions of his love of Mary are manifold. The painters who depicted him put the greeting \"Ave Maria\" on his lips, words he uttered so frequently that he was familiarly called \"Father Ave Maria.\" He had thousands of images of the Most Holy Virgin printed with the inscription: \"Ave Maria,\" which he also sent abroad. He had rosaries made with seventy-two blue beads on a white cord, symbols of the Assumption and the Immaculate Conception, and also a reminder that Mary, according to the belief of the time, lived to the age of 72 years. He sent these rosaries everywhere, even to England. Using his influence at Court, he had the angelic greeting so dear to him, \"Ave Maria,\" engraved in letters of gold on the facade of the royal palace in Madrid. On May 12, 1621, he was elected provincial of Castilla. On January 1, 1622, he was chosen to be the confessor of Queen Isabel of Borbon. On June 5, 1622, he petitioned the Holy See for the approval of his liturgical text composed in honor of the Sweet Name of Mary, which Pope Innocent XI later extended to the universal Church. After his death on September 29, 1624, the honors bestowed on him at his funeral took on the aspect of an anticipated canonization. For twelve days, the most re-known preachers of Madrid exalted his virtues and his holiness. Impressed with this unanimous veneration, on October 8, shortly after Fr. Simon's death, the Papal Nuncio ordered the beginning of the process leading to his glorification by the Church. His heroic virtues were recognized by Clement XII on March 25, 1735. He was beatified by Clement XIII on March 19, 1766. On July 3, 1988, just before the close of the Marian Year, Pope John Paul II, included St. Simón de Rojas on the calendar of saints.</p><hr /><h3>St. Wenceslaus(Martyr († 936))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT WENCESLAUS Martyr( 936) St. Wenceslaus was the son of a Christian duke of Bohemia, but his mother was a materialistic pagan. Through the care of his holy grandmother, Ludmilla (herself a martyr), Wenceslaus was educated in the complete faith and gained a holy devotion to the Eucharist. When Wenceslaus' father passed away, his mother, Drahomira, usurped leadership and passed a series of persecuting laws. In the interest of the Faith, Wenceslaus obtained - through the support of the people - a large portion of the country as his own kingdom. Drahomira secured the apostasy and alliance of her second son, Boleslas. Wenceslaus meanwhile ruled as a brave and pious king. When his domain was attacked, he overcame the leader of the invading army in single combat. While attending a banquet at his brother's palace, Wenceslaus went to pray before the Tabernacle at midnight. As he prayed, an assassin approached and struck him dead. He was killed for being loyal to St. Peter. He passed away on the Feast of the Archangels in 936.</p>"

Taking some of the spirit that was on Moses, he bestowed it on the seventy elders; and as the spirit came to rest on them, they prophesied.<br />Now two men, one named Eldad and the other Medad, were not in the gathering but had been left in the camp. They too had been on the list, but had not gone out to the tent; yet the spirit came to rest on them also, and they prophesied in the camp.<br />So, when a young man quickly told Moses, \"Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp,\"<br />Joshua, son of Nun, who from his youth had been Moses' aide, said, \"Moses, my lord, stop them.\"<br />But Moses answered him, \"Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the people of the LORD were prophets!

You have stored up treasure for the last days.<br />Behold, the wages you withheld from the workers who harvested your fields are crying aloud, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.<br />You have lived on earth in luxury and pleasure; you have fattened your hearts for the day of slaughter.<br />You have condemned; you have murdered the righteous one; he offers you no resistance.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Mark</h3><em>9,38-43.45.47-48.</em><p>John said to Jesus, \"Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him because he does not follow us.\"<br />Jesus replied, \"Do not prevent him. There is no one who performs a mighty deed in my name who can at the same time speak ill of me.<br />For whoever is not against us is for us.<br />Anyone who gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ, amen, I say to you, will surely not lose his reward.<br />Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were put around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.<br />If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed than with two hands to go into Gehenna, into the unquenchable fire.<br />And if your foot causes you to sin, cut if off.

Better for you to enter into the Kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into Gehenna,<br />where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.</p><hr /><h3>St. Michael Archangel - Feast()</h3><p>SAINT MICHAEL Archangel(Feast) St. Michael the Archangel cast down Satan from heaven with a cry: \"Mikha'el\"; meaning, \"Who is like God?\" St. Michael is an intercessor and the defender of beleaguered souls. His loyalty to Christ is unparalleled. Hence his loyalty to humanity, among whom Christ is firstborn (Col. 1:15). St. Michael appears in Holy Scripture as the guardian of the children of Israel: their comfort and protector in times of sorrow or conflict. He prepares for their return from the Persian captivity, leads the valiant Maccabees to victory, and rescues the body of Moses from the envious grasp of the Evil One. Ever since Christ's coming, the Church venerates St. Michael as her special patron and protector. She invokes him by name in her confession of sin, summons him to her children's side in the agony of death, and chooses him as their escort from the chastening flames of purgatory to the realms of holy light. When the Antichrist sets up a kingdom on earth, St. Michael will unfurl the standard of the Cross, sound the last trumpet, and binding together the false prophet and the beast, hurl them into the fire for eternity.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gabriel Archangel - Feast()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Gabriel Archangel(Feast) Saint Gabriel, whose name means \"God's strength,\" is mentioned in the Bible four times. In Daniel 8, he explains the vision of the horned ram as portending the destruction of the Persian Empire by the Macedonian Alexander the Great; after whose death the kingdom will be divided up among his generals, from one of whom will spring Antiochus Epiphanes. In chapter 9, after Daniel prayed for Israel, we read that \"the man Gabriel . . . flying swiftly touched me\" and he communicated to him the mysterious prophecy of the \"seventy weeks\" of years which should elapse before the coming of Christ. Most significant are Gabriel's two mentions in the New Testament: to announce the birth of John the Baptist to his father Zacharias, and to foretell to Mary the Incarnation of the Word in her womb.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raphael Archangel - Feast()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Raphael Archangel(Feast) St. Raphael the Archangel is venerated in the Book of Tobit for miracles of healing, protection and holy encounters. For these reasons, he is invoked by Christians, especially for encounters leading to marriage. Raphael's name means, \"God has healed.\" In the Book of Tobit, St. Raphael appears disguised in human form as the travelling companion of the younger Tobias, calling himself \"Azarias, the son of the great Ananias.\" During the journey, the protective influence of St. Raphael is shown in many ways, including the binding \"in the desert of upper Egypt\" of the demon who had previously slain seven husbands of Sara, daughter of Raguel. After their return and the healing of the blindness of the elder Tobias, Azarias makes himself known as \"the angel Raphael, one of the seven, who stand before the Lord\" (Tobit 12:15).</p>"

He attended school in Rome, but his thirst for knowledge was excessive and his love for books a passion. He studied under the best masters, visited foreign cities and devoted himself to the pursuit of science. Little did he know that Jesus had need of his strong will and penetrating intellect. When St. Jerome encountered Jesus Christ, he died to himself. He made a vow of celibacy, departed Rome and lived in the wild Syrian desert. There, for four years, he learned penance, prayer and divine wisdom. When the pope besought St. Jerome to revise the Latin Bible, the latter used his fluency in Hebrew to great effect. The Latin Revision was St. Jerome's magnum opus and a blessing from the Holy Spirit. Retiring afterward to his beloved Bethlehem, he illuminated our Christian faith for another thirty years.</p>"
