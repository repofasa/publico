Now Nineveh was an enormously large city; it took three days to go through it.<br />Jonah began his journey through the city, and had gone but a single day's walk announcing, \"Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed,\"<br />when the people of Nineveh believed God; they proclaimed a fast and all of them, great and small, put on sackcloth.<br />When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he rose from his throne, laid aside his robe, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in the ashes.<br />Then he had this proclaimed throughout Nineveh, by decree of the king and his nobles: \"Neither man nor beast, neither cattle nor sheep, shall taste anything; they shall not eat, nor shall they drink water.<br />Man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth and call loudly to God; every man shall turn from his evil way and from the violence he has in hand.<br />Who knows, God may relent and forgive, and withhold his blazing wrath, so that we shall not perish.\"<br />When God saw by their actions how they turned from their evil way, he repented of the evil that he had threatened to do to them; he did not carry it out.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>51(50),3-4.12-13.18-19.</em><p>Have mercy on me, O God, in your goodness; <br />in the greatness of your compassion wipe out my offense.<br />Thoroughly wash me from my guilt <br />and of my sin cleanse me.<br />A clean heart create for me, O God, <br />and a steadfast spirit renew within me.<br />Cast me not out from your presence, <br />and your Holy Spirit take not from me.<br />For you are not pleased with sacrifices; <br />should I offer a burnt offering, you would not accept it.<br />My sacrifice, O God, is a contrite spirit; <br />a heart contrite and humbled, O God, you will not spurn.  </p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>11,29-32.</em><p>While still more people gathered in the crowd, Jesus said to them, \"This generation is an evil generation; it seeks a sign, but no sign will be given it, except the sign of Jonah.<br />Just as Jonah became a sign to the Ninevites, so will the Son of Man be to this generation.<br />At the judgment the queen of the south will rise with the men of this generation and she will condemn them, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and there is something greater than Solomon here.<br />At the judgment the men of Nineveh will arise with this generation and condemn it, because at the preaching of Jonah they repented, and there is something greater than Jonah here.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Albinus(Bishop (+ 550))</h3><p>SAINT ALBINUSBishop(469- 550) St. Albinus was descended from a noble family in Brittany. He was faithful and pious, which testifies to the virtue of his parents. Through the Church's traditions, Albinus received the Lord with the spirit and fervor of the saints. With his vocation in sight, he embraced the monastic state at Tintillant, near Angers. At thirty-five, Fr. Albinus was appointed abbot of his monastery. Twenty-five years later, he was consecrated Bishop of Angers. Bp. Albinus restored discipline in the Church: \"His disciples remembered ... 'Zeal for your house will consume me'\" (Jn. 2:17, Ps. 69:9). Bp. Albinus' mortifications of the flesh and constant recollection of soul disposed his spirit to the will of the Divine.Powerful in works and miracles, Bp. Albinus looked upon himself as an \"unprofitable servant\" (Lk. 17:10). In the third Council of Orleans, in 538, he procured the revival of the thirtieth canon of the Council of Epaone: those who contract incestuous marriages in the first or second degree of consanguinity were excommunicated. For his humility in relying upon the will of God rather than his own, Jesus' mercy received Fr. Albinus into heaven, where he intercedes on our behalf forever and ever.</p><hr /><h3>St. David(Bishop (+ 561))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT DAVIDBishop(+ 561) St. David, son of Sant, Prince of Cardigan and of Non, was born at Wales in the fifth century. From his earliest years and beginning the age of reason, he gave himself to serving God. He began his religious life under St. Paulinus, a disciple of St. Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, who Pope Celestine sent to Britain to stop Pelagius' heresy. When the heresy reappeared at the beginning of the sixth century, the bishops assembled at Brevi. Unable to address the people, they sent for Fr. David from his cell to preach. Fr. David came, and it is related that, as he preached, the ground beneath his feet rose and became a hill - so that he was heard by an innumerable crowd. The heresy fell under the sword of the Spirit; and upon St. Dubricius' resignation, Fr. David was elected Bishop of Caerleon. Bp. David founded twelve monasteries and governed the Church according to the canons sanctioned in Rome. When he was eighty, he laid himself down knowing his hour had come. As his agony closed, our Lord stood before him in a vision, and the Saint cried out: \"Take me up with Thee\"; and so gave up his soul on Tuesday, March 1, 561.</p>"

Leo and Hilarius, succeeding them in the pontificate in 468. His pontificate was beset by persecution. All the provinces of the Western Empire out of Italy had fallen into the hands of Gothic peoples. In the eighth year of Simplicius' pontificate, Rome fell prey to foreigners. Italy was left almost a desert without inhabitants; and the imperial armies consisted chiefly of Gothic mercenaries, hired under the name of auxiliaries. When the mercenaries saw that their masters were in their power, the Heruli demanded one third of the lands of Italy. They chose Odoacer for their leader, a resolute and intrepid man, who was proclaimed king of Rome in 476. To ensure his kingship, Odoacer executed Orestes, the empire's regent for his son Augustulus. Mercifully, Odoacer spared Augustulus, and appointed him a salary of six thousand pounds of gold with permission to live at full liberty near Naples.Pope Simplicius was wholly taken up in comforting and relieving the afflicted, and in sowing the seeds of the Catholic faith among the Goths. The East gave Pope Simplicius no less employment and concern. Peter Cnapheus, a Eutychian, was made Patriarch of Antioch by heretics; and Peter Mengus made Patriach of Alexandria. Acacius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, accepted Pope Simplicius' verdict against Cnapheus, but supported Mengus in secret. When Pope Simplicius discovered Acacius' intrigues, he redoubled his efforts to maintain the one, complete faith. Pope Simplicius was a servant of the servants. He led the Church as pope for fifteen years, eleven months and six days. He passed away in 483 and was buried in St. Peter's on the second of March.</p><hr /><h3>St. Chad()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Bl.

Her father was a well-known banker and philanthropist. Both parents instilled in their daughters that wealth was simply loaned and should be shared. When the family took a trip to the Western part of the United States, Katharine, as a young woman, saw the plight of the natives. This experience inflamed her desire to do something specific to help alleviate their condition. This was the beginning of her lifelong personal and financial support of numerous missions and missionaries in the United States. The first school she established was St. Catherine Native American School in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1887). Later, when visiting Pope Leo XIII in Rome, she asked him for missionaries to staff some of the native missions that she as a lay person was financing. She was surprised to hear the pope suggest that she become a missionary herself. After consulting her spiritual director, Bishop James O'Connor, she made the decision to give herself totally to God, along with her inheritance, through service to natives and Blacks. Katharine's wealth was now transformed into a poverty of spirit that became a daily constant in a life supported only by the bare necessities. On February 12, 1891, she professed her first vows as a religious. She founded the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament to share the message of the Gospel and the life of the Eucharist among natives and Blacks. Always a woman of intense prayer, Sr. Katharine experienced the Eucharist as the summit of Christian life. It was the source of her love for the oppressed and gave her the courage to combat the effects of racism. Knowing that many Blacks lived in substandard conditions as sharecroppers or underpaid laborers, denied educational and constitutional rights, Sr. Katharine felt a compassionate urgency to change racial attitudes in the United States. The plantation was an entrenched social institution; and the oppression of colored people was a deep affront to Sr. Katharine's sense of justice. The need for quality education loomed before her, and she discussed this need with others. At the time, restrictions of law prevented colored people from obtaining a basic education in the rural South. Founding and staffing schools for natives and Blacks became a priority for Sr. Katharine and her congregation. During her lifetime, she opened, staffed and directly supported nearly sixty schools and missions, especially in the Western and Southwestern United States. Her crowning educational focus was the establishment of Xavier University of Louisiana in 1925, the only predominantly Black Catholic institution of higher learning in the United States. Religious education and social services, and visiting homes, hospitals and prisons, were also included in her ministries. In her quiet way, Sr. Katharine combined prayerful and total dependence on Divine Providence with determined activism. Her joyous incisiveness, attuned to the Holy Spirit, penetrated obstacles and facilitated her advances for social justice. Through the prophetic witness of Sr. Katharine Drexel's initiatives, the Church in the United States became aware of the grave domestic need for an apostolate among natives and Blacks. Sr. Katharine did not hesitate to speak out against injustice, taking a public stance when racial discrimination was in evidence. Sr. Katharine left a four-fold dynamic legacy to her Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament who continue her apostolate:– her love for the Eucharist, her spirit of prayer and her Eucharistic perspective on the unity of all peoples;– her undaunted spirit of courageous initiative in addressing social iniquities among minorities — one hundred years before such concern aroused public interest in the United States;– her belief in the importance of quality education for all, and her efforts to achieve it;– her total giving of self, of her inheritance and all material goods in selfless service of the victims of injustice. For the last eighteen years of her life, Sr. Katharine was rendered almost completely immobile because of a serious illness. During these years, she gave herself to a life of adoration and contemplation, which she desired from early childhood. Sr. Katharine passed away on March 3, 1955. She was beatified by Pope John Paul II on November 20, 1980.</p><hr /><h3>St. Cunegundes(Empress (+ 1040))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT CUNEGUNDESEmpress(+1040) St. Cunegundes was the daughter of Siegfried, the first Count of Luxemburg, and Hadeswige, his pious wife. They raised Cunegundes in the faith; and married her to St. Henry, Duke of Bavaria. When Emperor Otho III passed away, Henry was chosen king of the Romans, and crowned on June 6, 1002. Queen Cunegundes was crowned at Paderborn on St. Laurence's day. On February 14, 1014, Queen Cunegundes and King Henry received the imperial crown from Pope Benedict VIII. Cunegundes had, by Henry's consent before their marriage, made a vow of virginity. When calumniators made vile accusations against her, the holy empress walked unhurt over red-hot ploughshares: thus proving her innocence and removing the scandal. Emperor Henry condemned his fears and credulity; and from that time on, they lived in the strictest union of hearts: conspiring to promote in everything God's honor and the advancement of piety. Going once to make a retreat in Hesse, Queen Cunegundes fell dangerously ill. She made a vow to found a monastery if she recovered. After recovering, she founded a monatery at Kaffungen, near Cassel, in the diocese of Paderborn, and gave it to nuns of the Order of St. Benedict. Before it was finished, King Henry passed away on July 13, 1024. She recommended his soul to the prayers of others, especially to her dear nuns, and expressed her desire of joining them. She had already exhausted her treasures in founding bishoprics and monasteries and in relieving the poor, and she had little left to give. Still thirsting to embrace perfect poverty, and to renounce all to serve God without obstacle, she assembled a great number of prelates to the dedication of her church of Kaffungen, in 1025, on the anniversary of her husband's passing. After the gospel was sung at Mass, she offered a piece of the true cross on the altar. Putting off her imperial robes, she clothed herself with a poor habit: Her hair was cut off, and the bishop put a veil and a ring on her as a pledge of fidelity to her heavenly Spouse. After she was consecrated to God in religion, Sr. Cunegundes seemed to forget entirely that she had been empress, and behaved as the last in the house, being persuaded that she was so before God. She prayed and read much, worked with her hands, and took a singular pleasure in visiting and comforting the sick.Thus she passed the last fifteen years of her life. Her mortifications at length reduced her to a very weak condition, and brought on her last sickness. Perceiving that they were preparing a cloth fringed with gold to cover her body after death, she changed color and ordered it to be taken away. She was not at rest till promised she would be buried as a poor religious in her habit. She passed away on March 3, 1040. Her body was carried to Bamberg and buried near that of her husband. She was solemnly canonized by Pope Innocent III in 1200.</p>"

He received spiritual formation and tutoring from John Dlugosz. Prince Casimir's conscientious objection to others' caprices showed his wisdom, maturity and caritas. He prayed routinely and led a chaste, disciplined life. When nobles in Hungary deposed an elected king, a fraction besought the aid of Poland's king. The king of Poland, together with Prince Casimir, amassed an army to reinstate the elected ruler. Due to their enemy's cunning, the prince and king went unsupported by the nobles. To make matters worse, many Polish mercenaries deserted after going unpaid. Ultimately, the Casimirs retreated and the prince was left feeling helpless. Polish propoganda nonetheless portrayed Prince Casimir as a hero, which may have in part motivated his pivot toward discretion and devoutness. Prince Casimir continued serving his country in a supporting role. He, together with his kin, did not engage in wars of conquest, but rather mediated where political intrests caused conflict. While the prince continued his good works, piety and receiving the sacraments, his health deteriorated. He may have remained celibate and declined marriage to the emperor’s daughter after sensing his impending death. Prince Casimir reigned briefly as king of Poland during his father’s absence. At twenty three years old, he passed away from lung sickness while visiting Lithuania. He was the Grand Duke of Lithuania, and was buried in Vilnius. He is the patron saint of Poland and Lithuania.</p>"

At the gates, they were asked where they were going and on what errand. After confessing their faith in Jesus Christ, the brothers were arrested and tried. The judge who sentenced them first ordered their sides torn with iron hooks. Two days after their torture and sentencing, the brothers were sent to be executed. At a pagan festival in Cæsarea, Adrian was fed to a lion. The lion mangled Adrian without killing him, so he was executed by a gladiator. Two days later, Eubulus was offered freedom if he sacrificed to idols. Eubulus courageouly refused, and was led to the amphitheater and killed by lions. At the time of their martyrdom, the Church in Cæsarea had been persecuted for twelve years under three successive governors: Flavian, Urban and Firmilian. The Church buckled under the storm of persecution only to rise and rise again. The brothers' sacrifice was not in vain because the Church was edified and their miracles enduring.</p><hr /><h3>St. Kieran()</h3><hr />"

Preferring a more austere regimen, she entered the Third Order of St. Francis and lived in a hut near the parish church of Corbie in Picardy. After four years of extraordinary penance, St. Francis spoke to Sr. Colette in a vision to reform the Order. With blessing and authority, she established her reform throughout a large part of Europe. In spite of opposition, she founded seventeen convents of the strict observance. By the same wonderful prudence, Sr. Colette healed a schism afflicting the Church. The Fathers at Constance were unable to mediate between the claimants to the tiara: John XXIII, Benedict XIII and Gregory XII. Sr. Colette, together with St. Vincent Ferrer, wrote to the Fathers and deposed Benedict XIII, who alone refused a new election. The reset led to Martin V being elected for the greater good of the Church. Sr. Colette also assisted the Council of Basle by her advice and prayers. When God revealed to her the spirit of revolt that was arising, she warned the bishops and legates to retire from the council. Sr. Colette prayed for the Church even when devils attacked her. Choosing God in the pain of darkness and desolation was so dear and pleasing to Him that Sr. Colette received His divine consolation. Demons sometimes took the form of stinging insects, or brought the corpses of public criminals into her cell, or assumed monstrous forms to strike her. Other times, they appeared as seductions and false goods. Sr. Colette once complained to Our Lord that the demons prevented her from praying. Like St. Padre Pio, God showed her that prayer was more pleasing when it was done in times of trial or spiritual dryness. Sr. Colette passed away on March 6, 1447. Seeing God in heaven because her spirit was perfectly conformed to the Divine, St. Colette intercedes for those who ask her with faith.</p>"

It will not mean the loss of instruction from the priests, nor of counsel from the wise, nor of messages from the prophets. And so, let us destroy him by his own tongue; let us carefully note his every word.\"<br />Heed me, O LORD, and listen to what my adversaries say.<br />Must good be repaid with evil that they should dig a pit to take my life? Remember that I stood before you to speak in their behalf, to turn away your wrath from them.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>31(30),5-6.14.15-16.</em><p>You will free me from the snare they set for me, <br />for you are my refuge.<br />Into your hands I commend my spirit; <br />You will redeem me, O LORD, O faithful God.<br />I hear the whispers of the crowd, that frighten me from every side, <br />as they consult together against me, plotting to take my life.<br />But my trust is in you, O LORD; <br />I say, \"You are my God.<br />In your hands is my destiny; rescue me <br />from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>20,17-28.</em><p>As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the Twelve disciples aside by themselves, and said to them on the way,<br />Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death,<br />and hand him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and scourged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day.\"<br />Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons and did him homage, wishing to ask him for something.<br />He said to her, \"What do you wish?\" She answered him, \"Command that these two sons of mine sit, one at your right and the other at your left, in your kingdom.\"<br />Jesus said in reply, \"You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I am going to drink?\" They said to him, \"We can.\"<br />He replied, \"My cup you will indeed drink, but to sit at my right and at my left, this is not mine to give but is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.\"<br />When the ten heard this, they became indignant at the two brothers.<br />But Jesus summoned them and said, \"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones make their authority over them felt.<br />But it shall not be so among you. Rather, whoever wishes to be great among you shall be your servant;<br />whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave.<br />Just so, the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. John of God(religious (1495-1550))</h3><p>SAINT JOHN OF GOD Religious (1495-1550) Nothing in John's early life foreshadowed his future sanctity. He ran away from his home in Portugal, tended sheep and cattle in Spain, served as a soldier against the French and afterward against the Turks. Around forty years of age, feeling remorse for his wild life, John devoted himself to ransoming Christian slaves in Africa. He went there with the family of an exiled noble, whom he supported with his labor. After returning to Spain, he began selling holy pictures and books at low prices. At length, the hour of grace struck. At Granada, a sermon by the celebrated John of Avila shook his soul to its depths; and his expressions of self-abhorrence were so extraordinary that he was taken to the asylum. There, he employed himself in ministering to the sick. After leaving the asylum, John began sheltering homeless poor and supporting them through work and begging. One night, he found a poor man who seemed near death lying in the streets. John carried the man to the hospital, laid him on a bed and went to fetch water to wash his feet. When he had washed them, he knelt to kiss them, and started with awe: The feet were pierced, and the print of the nails bright with an unearthly radiance. He raised his eyes to look, and heard the words, \"John, to Me thou doest all that thou doest to the poor in My name: I reach forth My hand for the alms thou givest; Me dost thou clothe, Mine are the feet thou dost wash.\" And then the gracious vision disappeared, leaving John filled with wonderment and consolation. The bishop became the Saint's patron and gave him the name John of God. When his hospital was on fire, John was seen rushing about uninjured amidst the flames until he had rescued all his poor. After ten years spent serving the poor, John was called to heaven. He plunged into the river Xenil to save a drowning boy, and passed away from an illness brought on by the attempt. He was fifty-five; and was welcomed by Jesus into eternity.</p>"

Dogs even used to come and lick his sores.<br />When the poor man died, he was carried away by angels to the bosom of Abraham. The rich man also died and was buried,<br />and from the netherworld, where he was in torment, he raised his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side.<br />And he cried out, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me. Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am suffering torment in these flames.'<br />Abraham replied, 'My child, remember that you received what was good during your lifetime while Lazarus likewise received what was bad; but now he is comforted here, whereas you are tormented.<br />Moreover, between us and you a great chasm is established to prevent anyone from crossing who might wish to go from our side to yours or from your side to ours.'<br />He said, 'Then I beg you, father, send him to my father's house,<br />for I have five brothers, so that he may warn them, lest they too come to this place of torment.'<br />But Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them.'<br />He said, 'Oh no, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'<br />Then Abraham said, 'If they will not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone should rise from the dead.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Frances of Rome(religious (1384-1440))</h3><p>SAINT FRANCES OF ROME Religious (1384-1440) St. Frances was born at Rome in 1384. Her parents were high-ranking officials. They overruled her desire to become a nun, and at twelve married her to Rorenzo Ponziano, a Roman noble. During the forty years of their married life, they never had a disagreement. While spending her days in retirement and prayer, she attended promptly to every household duty, saying, \"A married woman must leave God at the altar to find Him in her domestic cares.\" Her ordinary food was bread and water, but she would bring sumptuous food to the poor and needy. During the invasion of Rome in 1413, Ponziano was banished. His estates were confiscated, his house was destroyed, and his eldest son was taken hostage. Frances saw in these losses only the finger of God, and blessed His holy name. When peace was restored, Ponziano recovered his estate, and Frances founded the Oblates. After her husband's death, barefoot and with a cord around her neck, Frances sought admission to the community; and was soon elected superioress. She was constanly aware of the presence of God, and among many visions was given sight of her guardian angel: who shed such brightness that she could read her midnight office. Sr. Frances' guardian angel shielded her in the hour of temptation and directed her in every good act. When she was betrayed into some defect, he faded from her sight; and when some light words were spoken before her, he covered his face in shame. Sr. Frances passed way on March 9, 1440, on the day she had foretold. She was canonized in 1608 in recognition of her heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from her intercession.</p>"

Get ready; I will send you to them.\" \"I am ready,\" Joseph answered.<br />The man told him, \"They have moved on from here; in fact, I heard them say, 'Let us go on to Dothan.'\" So Joseph went after his brothers and caught up with them in Dothan.<br />They noticed him from a distance, and before he came up to them, they plotted to kill him.<br />They said to one another: \"Here comes that master dreamer!<br />Come on, let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns here; we could say that a wild beast devoured him.

Looking up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead, their camels laden with gum, balm and resin to be taken down to Egypt.<br />Judah said to his brothers: \"What is to be gained by killing our brother and concealing his blood?<br />Rather, let us sell him to these Ishmaelites, instead of doing away with him ourselves. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh.\" His brothers agreed.<br />They sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver. Some Midianite traders passed by, and they pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and took him to Egypt.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>105(104),16-17.18-19.20-21.</em><p>When the LORD called down a famine on the land <br />and ruined the crop that sustained them,<br />He sent a man before them, <br />Joseph, sold as a slave.<br />They had weighed him down with fetters, <br />and he was bound with chains,<br />Till his prediction came to pass <br />and the word of the LORD proved him true.<br />The king sent and released him, <br />the ruler of the peoples set him free.<br />He made him lord of his house <br />and ruler of all his possessions.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>21,33-43.45-46.</em><p>Jesus said to the chief priests and the elders of the people: \"Hear another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a hedge around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a tower. Then he leased it to tenants and went on a journey.<br />When vintage time drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to obtain his produce.<br />But the tenants seized the servants and one they beat, another they killed, and a third they stoned.<br />Again he sent other servants, more numerous than the first ones, but they treated them in the same way.<br />Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, 'They will respect my son.'<br />But when the tenants saw the son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and acquire his inheritance.'<br />They seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.<br />What will the owner of the vineyard do to those tenants when he comes?\"<br />They answered him, \"He will put those wretched men to a wretched death and lease his vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the proper times.\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"Did you never read in the scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; by the Lord has this been done, and it is wonderful in our eyes'?<br />Therefore, I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that will produce its fruit.<br />When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was speaking about them.<br />And although they were attempting to arrest him, they feared the crowds, for they regarded him as a prophet.</p><hr /><h3>St. Marie Eugenie of Jesus(foundress of the Religious of the Assumption (1817-1898))</h3><p>Saint Marie Eugenie of JesusFoundress of the Religious of the Assumption (1817 - 1898) Anne Marie Eugenie was born in 1817, in Metz, after Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of the monarchy. She belonged to a non-believing and financially comfortable family. It seemed unlikely that she would trace a new spiritual path across the Church in France. Anne Marie's father was a follower of Voltaire and a liberal, and made his fortune in banking and in politics. Her mother provided an education, which developed Anne Marie's character and gave her a strong sense of duty. Family life developed Anne Marie's intellectual curiosity, romantic spirit, interest in social questions and a broad world view. Like her contemporary, George Sand, Anne Marie went to Mass on feast days and received the Sacraments of initiation, but did so according to custom and without real commitment. However, her First Communion was a mystical experience that foretold the secret of her future. She did not grasp its prophetic meaning until much later when she recognized it as her path towards total belonging to Jesus Christ and the Church. Anne Marie's youth was happy, but not without suffering. When she was a child, her elder brother and a baby sister passed away, which deeply affected her. Anne Marie's health was delicate and a fall from a horse left serious consequences. She was mature for her age and learned how to hide her feelings and to face up to events. Later, after a prosperous period for her father, she experienced the failure of his banks, the misunderstanding and eventual separation of her parents and the loss of all security. She had to leave her family home and go to Paris while Louis, closest to her in age and a faithful companion, went to live with their father. Eugenie went to Paris with the mother she adored, only to see her die from cholera after a few hours of illness, leaving her alone at the age of fifteen in a society that was worldly and superficial. Searching in anguish and almost desperate for the truth, she came ever-nearer to her conversion. When she was nineteen, Anne Marie attended the Lenten Conferences at Notre Dame in Paris, preached by the young Abbe Lacordaire, already well-known for his talent as orator. Lacordaire was a former disciple of Lamennais ­- haunted by the vision of a renewed Church with a special place in the world. He understood his time and wanted to change it. He understood young people, their questions and their desires, their idealism and their ignorance of both Christ and the Church. His words touched Anne Marie's heart, answered her many questions, and aroused her generosity. Anne Marie envisaged Christ as the universal liberator and his kingdom on earth established as a peaceful and just society. \"I was truly converted,\" she wrote, \"and I was seized by a longing to devote all my strength or rather all my weakness to the Church which, from that moment, I saw as alone holding the key to the knowledge and achievement of all that is good.\" Just at this time, another preacher, also a former disciple of Lamennais, appeared on the scene. In the confessional, Father Combalot recognized that he had encountered a chosen soul who was designated to be the foundress of the Congregation he had dreamed of for a long time. He persuaded Eugenie to undertake his work by insisting that this Congregation was willed by God who had chosen her to establish it. He convinced her that only by education could she evangelize minds, make families truly Christian and thus transform the society of her time. Anne Marie accepted the project as God's will for her and allowed herself to be guided by the Abbe Combalot. At twenty-two, Anne Marie became foundress of the Religious of the Assumption, dedicated to consecrate their whole life and strength to extending the Kingdom of Christ in themselves and in the world. In 1839, Mademoiselle Eugenie Milleret, with two other young women, began a life of prayer and study in a flat at rue Ferou near the church of St. Sulpice in Paris. In 1841, under the patronage of Madame de Chateaubriand, Lacordaire, Montalembert and their friends, the sisters opened their first school. In a relatively short time, there were sixteen sisters of four nationalities in the community. Anne Marie and the first sisters wanted to link the ancient and the new: uniting the past treasures of the Church's spirituality and wisdom with a type of religious life and education able to satisfy the demands of modern minds. It was a matter of respecting the values of the period and at the same time, making the Gospel values penetrate the rising culture of a new industrial and scientific era. The spirituality of the Congregation, centered on Christ and the Incarnation, was both deeply contemplative and dedicated to apostolic action. It was a life given to the search for God and the love and service of others. Anne Marie's long life covered almost the whole of the 19th century. She loved her times passionately and took an active part in their history. Progressively, she channeled all her energy and gifts in tending and extending the Congregation, which became her life work. God gave her sisters and many friends. One of the first sisters was Irish, a mystic and her intimate friend whom she called at the end of her life, \"half of myself.\" Kate O'Neill, called Mother Therese Emmanuel in religion, is considered as a co-foundress. Father Emmanuel d'Alzon, became Anne Marie's spiritual director soon after the foundation; and was a father, brother or friend according to the seasons. In 1845, he founded the Augustinians of the Assumption and the two founders helped each other in a multitude of ways over a period of forty years. Both had a gift for friendship and they inspired many lay people to work with them and the Church. Together, as they followed Christ and labored with him, the religious and laity traced the path of the Assumption and took their place in the great cloud of witnesses. In the last years of her life, Mother Anne Marie Eugenie experienced a progressive physical weakening, which she lived in silence and humility - a life totally centered on Christ. She received the Eucharist for the last time on March 9, 1898, and on the 10th, she gently passed over to the Lord. She was beatified by Pope Paul VI on February 9, 1975, and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on June 3, 2007, in Rome.</p><hr /><h3>The Forty Martyrs of Sebaste († c. 320)()</h3><hr /><p>THE FORTY MARTYRS OF SEBASTE ( c. 320) The forty martyrs were soldiers quartered at Sebaste in Armenia around 320 A.D. When their legion was ordered to offer pagan sacrifice, the forty men declined. As punishment, they were scourged and torn with iron hooks, chained together and left to a lingering death. In the dead of winter, the men were condemned to freeze on the icy surface of a pond. With Christ so near in the trial before death, they removed their own garments and shambled - chained - toward the pond, singing hymns. To tempt them, the secular authorities placed hot baths nearby, yet not even one renounced his faith. They remained steadfast, and passed away one by one. Among the forty, there was a young soldier who held out the longest. When the officers came to cart away the bodies, they asked him to change his mind; but the soldier's mother encouraged him to triumph. He made a sign of recognition before being carried away; loyal and true to the very end. Forever in heaven, the martyrs praise God and intercede for us until the end of time.</p><hr /><h3>St. Macarius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

So the father divided the property between them.<br />After a few days, the younger son collected all his belongings and set off to a distant country where he squandered his inheritance on a life of dissipation.<br />When he had freely spent everything, a severe famine struck that country, and he found himself in dire need.<br />So he hired himself out to one of the local citizens who sent him to his farm to tend the swine.<br />And he longed to eat his fill of the pods on which the swine fed, but nobody gave him any.<br />Coming to his senses he thought, 'How many of my father's hired workers have more than enough food to eat, but here am I, dying from hunger.<br />I shall get up and go to my father and I shall say to him, \"Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.<br />I no longer deserve to be called your son; treat me as you would treat one of your hired workers.\"'<br />So he got up and went back to his father. While he was still a long way off, his father caught sight of him, and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, embraced him and kissed him.<br />His son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you; I no longer deserve to be called your son.'<br />But his father ordered his servants, 'Quickly bring the finest robe and put it on him; put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.<br />Take the fattened calf and slaughter it. Then let us celebrate with a feast,<br />because this son of mine was dead, and has come to life again; he was lost, and has been found.' Then the celebration began.<br />Now the older son had been out in the field and, on his way back, as he neared the house, he heard the sound of music and dancing.<br />He called one of the servants and asked what this might mean.<br />The servant said to him, 'Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.'<br />He became angry, and when he refused to enter the house, his father came out and pleaded with him.<br />He said to his father in reply, 'Look, all these years I served you and not once did I disobey your orders; yet you never gave me even a young goat to feast on with my friends.<br />But when your son returns who swallowed up your property with prostitutes, for him you slaughter the fattened calf.'<br />He said to him, 'My son, you are here with me always; everything I have is yours.<br />But now we must celebrate and rejoice, because your brother was dead and has come to life again; he was lost and has been found.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Eulogius(Martyr (+ 859))</h3><p>SAINT EULOGIUS Martyr (+ 859) St. Eulogius' family and relatives were senators in Cordova, the capital of the Moors in Spain. He was educated by the clergy of the Church of St. Zoilus, a martyr, who suffered with nineteen others under Diocletian. Through dedication and supernatural and natural virtues, Eulogius was ordained a priest, and was appointed as director of the chief ecclesiastical school at Cordova. His adoration, fasting and prayer animated his humility, mildness and charity. During the persecution raised against the Christians in the year 850, Fr. Eulogius was imprisoned. He wrote his Exhortation to Martyrdom, addressed to the virgins Flora and Mary, who were beheaded on November 24, 851. Six days later, Eulogius wad released. In the year 852, several others suffered similar martyrdom. Fr. Eulogius inspired all these martyrs during their time of trial and supported the distressed flock. A virgin named Leocritia, from a noble Moorish family, had been instructed in Christianity by a relative since childhood. She was privately baptized, but was abused and beaten by her unbelieving parents. Leocritia told Fr. Eulogius and his sister Anulona that she desired to worship and adore Jesus freely. Hence Eulogius and Anulona provided sanctuary for Leocritia. When the plan was discovered, Leocritia and her cohorts were tried by the cadi. Eulogius was threatened with being scourged to death, but told his oppressors that he would never lose his faith. The cadi sent Eulogius to the king's council, but condemned him to be beheaded when he started proposing the truths of the Gospel. When the guards led Eulogius away, one of them struck him across the face. Eulogius turned the other cheek and patiently received a second. St. Eulogius surrendered his life with peace and serenity. He was beheaded on March 11, 859. St. Leocritia was beheaded four days later. Although her body was thrown into the river Guadalquivir, it was recovered and buried by Christians.</p><hr /><h3>St. Oengus()</h3><hr />"

Strike the rock, and the water will flow from it for the people to drink.\" This Moses did, in the presence of the elders of Israel.<br />The place was called Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled there and tested the LORD, saying, \"Is the LORD in our midst or not?\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>95(94),1-2.6-7.8-9.</em><p>Come, let us sing joyfully to the LORD; <br />let us acclaim the Rock of our salvation.<br />Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving; <br />let us joyfully sing psalms to him.<br />Come, let us bow down in worship; <br />let us kneel before the LORD who made us.<br />For he is our God, <br />and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.<br />Oh, that today you would hear his voice:<br />“Harden not your hearts as at Meribah, <br />as in the day of Massah in the desert,<br />Where your fathers tempted me; <br />they tested me though they had seen my works.”  </p><h3>Letter to the Romans</h3><em>5,1-2.5-8.</em><p>Brothers and sisters: Since we have been justified by faith,  we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,<br />through whom we have gained access (by faith) to this grace in which we stand, and we boast in hope of the glory of God.<br />and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us.<br />For Christ, while we were still helpless, yet died at the appointed time for the ungodly.<br />Indeed, only with difficulty does one die for a just person, though perhaps for a good person one might even find courage to die.<br />But God proves his love for us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>4,5-42.</em><p>Jesus came to a town of Samaria called Sychar,  near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.<br />Jacob's well was there. Jesus, tired from his journey, sat down there at the well. It was about noon.<br />A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, \"Give me a drink.\"<br />His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.<br />The Samaritan woman said to him, \"How can you, a Jew, ask me, a Samaritan woman, for a drink?\" (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)<br />Jesus answered and said to her, \"If you knew the gift of God and who is saying to you, 'Give me a drink,' you would have asked him and he would have given you living water.\"<br />(The woman) said to him, \"Sir, you do not even have a bucket and the cistern is deep; where then can you get this living water?<br />Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this cistern and drank from it himself with his children and his flocks?\"<br />Jesus answered and said to her, \"Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again;<br />but whoever drinks the water I shall give will never thirst; the water I shall give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.\"<br />The woman said to him, \"Sir, give me this water, so that I may not be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water.\"<br />Jesus said to her, \"Go call your husband and come back.\"<br />The woman answered and said to him, \"I do not have a husband.\" Jesus answered her, \"You are right in saying, 'I do not have a husband.'<br />For you have had five husbands, and the one you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true.\"<br />The woman said to him, \"Sir, I can see that you are a prophet.<br />Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain; but you people say that the place to worship is in Jerusalem.\"<br />Jesus said to her, \"Believe me, woman, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.<br />You people worship what you do not understand; we worship what we understand, because salvation is from the Jews.<br />But the hour is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in Spirit and truth; and indeed the Father seeks such people to worship him.<br />God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and truth.\"<br />The woman said to him, \"I know that the Messiah is coming, the one called the Anointed; when he comes, he will tell us everything.\"<br />Jesus said to her, \"I am he, the one who is speaking with you.\"<br />At that moment his disciples returned, and were amazed that he was talking with a woman, but still no one said, \"What are you looking for?\" or \"Why are you talking with her?\"<br />The woman left her water jar and went into the town and said to the people,<br />Come see a man who told me everything I have done. Could he possibly be the Messiah?<br />They went out of the town and came to him.<br />Meanwhile, the disciples urged him, \"Rabbi, eat.\"<br />But he said to them, \"I have food to eat of which you do not know.\"<br />So the disciples said to one another, \"Could someone have brought him something to eat?\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to finish his work.<br />Do you not say, 'In four months the harvest will be here'? I tell you, look up and see the fields ripe for the harvest.<br />The reaper is already receiving his payment and gathering crops for eternal life, so that the sower and reaper can rejoice together.<br />For here the saying is verified that 'One sows and another reaps.'<br />I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the work, and you are sharing the fruits of their work.\"<br />Many of the Samaritans of that town began to believe in him because of the word of the woman who testified, \"He told me everything I have done.\"<br />When the Samaritans came to him, they invited him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.<br />Many more began to believe in him because of his word,<br />and they said to the woman, \"We no longer believe because of your word; for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the savior of the world.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Luigi Orione(Priest (1872-1940))</h3><p>Saint Luigi Orione Priest (1872-1940) St. Luigi Orione was born in Pontecurone, diocese of Tortona, on June 23, 1872. At thirteen, he entered the Franciscan Friary of Voghera (Pavia), but he left after one year because of poor health. From 1886 to 1889, he was a pupil of St. John Bosco at the Valdocco Oratory (Youth Center) in Turin. On October 16, 1889, he joined the diocesan seminary of Tortona. As a young seminarian, he devoted himself to the care of others through membership in the San Marziano Society for Mutual Help and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul. On July 3, 1892, he opened the first Oratory in Tortona for the Christian formation of boys. On October 15, 1893, he started a boarding school for poor boys in the Saint Bernardine estate. On April 13, 1895, Luigi Orione was ordained a priest. At the event, the Bishop gave the clerical habit to six pupils of the boarding school. Within a brief span of time, Don Orione opened new houses at Mornico Losana (Pavia), Noto in Sicily, Sanremo and Rome. Around the young Founder, there grew up seminarians and priests who made up the first core group of the Little Work of Divine Providence. In 1899, Fr. Luigi founded the branch of the Hermits of Divine Providence. The Bishop of Tortona, Mgr. Igino Bandi, by a decree on March 21, 1903, issued the canonical approval of the Sons of Divine Providence (priests, lay brothers and hermits) - the male congregation of the Little Work of Divine Providence. The congregation's aim is to \"co-operate to bring the little ones, the poor and the people, to the Church and to the Pope, by means of the works of charity,\" and professes a fourth vow of special \"faithfulness to the Pope.\" In the first Constitutions of 1904, among the aims of the new Congregation, there appears that of working to \"achieve the union of the separated Churches.\" Inspired by a profound love for the Church and for the salvation of Souls, Fr. Luigi was actively interested in the new problems of his time, such as the freedom and unity of the Church, the Roman question, modernism, socialism and the Christian evangelization of industrial workers.He rushed to assist the victims of the earthquakes of Reggio and Messina (1908) and the Marsica region (1915). By appointment of Saint Pius X, he was made Vicar General of the diocese of Messina for three years. On June 29, 1915, twenty years after the foundation of the Sons of Divine Providence, he added to the \"single tree of many branches\" the Congregation of the Little Missionary Sisters of Charity who are inspired by the same founding charism. Alongside them, he placed the Blind Sisters, Adorers of the Blessed Sacrament. Later, the Contemplative Sisters of Jesus Crucified were also founded.For lay people, he set up the associations of the \"Ladies of Divine Providence,\" the \"Former Pupils,\" and the \"Friends.\" More recently, the Don Orione Secular Institute and the Don Orione Lay People's Movement have come into being. Following the First World War (1914-1918), the number of schools, boarding houses, agricultural schools, charitable and welfare works increased. Among his most enterprising and original works, he set up the \"Little Cottolengos\" for the care of the suffering and abandoned, which were usually built on the outskirts of large cities to act as \"new pulpits\" from which to speak of Christ and of the Church - \"true beacons of faith and of civilization.\" Don Orione's missionary zeal, which had already manifested itself in 1913 when he sent his first religious to Brazil, expanded subsequently to Argentina and Uruguay (1921), Palestine (1921), Poland (1923), Rhodes (1925), the USA (1934), England (1935), Albania (1936). From 1921-1922 and from 1934-1937, he made two missionary journeys to Latin America: to Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, going as far as Chile. He enjoyed the personal respect of the Popes and the Holy See's Authorities, who entrusted him with confidential tasks of sorting out problems and healing wounds, both inside the Church in society. He was a preacher, a confessor and a tireless organiser of pilgrimages, missions, processions, live cribs and other popular manifestations and celebrations of the faith. He loved Our Lady deeply and fostered devotion to her by every means possible and, through the manual labour of his seminarians, built the shrines of Our Lady of Safe Keeping in Tortona and Our Lady of Caravaggio at Fumo. In the winter of 1940, with the intention of easing the heart and lung complaints that were troubling him, he went to the Sanremo house, even though, as he said, \"it is not among the palm trees that I would like to die, but among the poor who are Jesus Christ.\" Only three days later, on March 12, 1940, surrounded by his confreres, Don Orione passed away while sighing, \"Jesus, Jesus! I am going.\" St. Luigi's body was found uncorrupted at its first exhumation in 1965. It has been exposed to the veneration of the faithful in the shrine of Our Lady of Safe Keeping in Tortona ever since October 26, 1980 - the day in which Pope John Paul II inscribed Don Luigi Orione in the Book of the Blessed. He was canonized on May 16, 2004.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maximilian()</h3><hr />"

But valiant as he was, the man was a leper.<br />Now the Arameans had captured from the land of Israel in a raid a little girl, who became the servant of Naaman's wife.<br />\"If only my master would present himself to the prophet in Samaria,\" she said to her mistress, \"he would cure him of his leprosy.\"<br />Naaman went and told his lord just what the slave girl from the land of Israel had said.<br />\"Go,\" said the king of Aram. \"I will send along a letter to the king of Israel.\" So Naaman set out, taking along ten silver talents, six thousand gold pieces, and ten festal garments.<br />To the king of Israel he brought the letter, which read: \"With this letter I am sending my servant Naaman to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy.\"<br />When he read the letter, the king of Israel tore his garments and exclaimed: \"Am I a god with power over life and death, that this man should send someone to me to be cured of leprosy? Take note! You can see he is only looking for a quarrel with me!\"<br />When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his garments, he sent word to the king: \"Why have you torn your garments? Let him come to me and find out that there is a prophet in Israel.\"<br />Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of Elisha's house.<br />The prophet sent him the message: \"Go and wash seven times in the Jordan, and your flesh will heal, and you will be clean.\"<br />But Naaman went away angry, saying, \"I thought that he would surely come out and stand there to invoke the LORD his God, and would move his hand over the spot, and thus cure the leprosy.<br />Are not the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them and be cleansed?\" With this, he turned about in anger and left.<br />But his servants came up and reasoned with him. \"My father,\" they said, \"if the prophet had told you to do something extraordinary, would you not have done it? All the more now, since he said to you, 'Wash and be clean,' should you do as he said.\"<br />So Naaman went down and plunged into the Jordan seven times at the word of the man of God. His flesh became again like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.<br />He returned with his whole retinue to the man of God. On his arrival he stood before him and said, \"Now I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel. Please accept a gift from your servant.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>42(41),2-3.43(42),3-4.</em><p>As the hind longs for the running waters, <br />so my soul longs for you, O God.<br />Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. <br />When shall I go and behold the face of God?<br />Send forth your light and your fidelity; <br />they shall lead me on <br />And bring me to your holy mountain, <br />to your dwelling place.<br />Then will I go in to the altar of God, <br />the God of my gladness and joy; <br />Then will I give you thanks upon the harp, <br />O God, my God!</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>4,24-30.</em><p>Jesus said to the people in the synagogue at Nazareth: \"Amen, I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his own native place.<br />Indeed, I tell you, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah when the sky was closed for three and a half years and a severe famine spread over the entire land.<br />It was to none of these that Elijah was sent, but only to a widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon.<br />Again, there were many lepers in Israel during the time of Elisha the prophet; yet not one of them was cleansed, but only Naaman the Syrian.\"<br />When the people in the synagogue heard this, they were all filled with fury.<br />They rose up, drove him out of the town, and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town had been built, to hurl him down headlong.<br />But he passed through the midst of them and went away.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euphrasia(Virgin and Martyr (+ 303))</h3><p>SAINT EUPHRASIA Virgin and Martyr(+ 303) The holy virgin Euphrasia lived in Nicomedia during the reign of Maximian. She was noble, virtuous, pure and faithful. When idolaters forced her to offer pagan sacrifice, she refused and was scourged. When the persecutors failed to break her, they gave her to a barbarian who would to rape her. On the way to the barbarian's house, Euphrasia prayed silently asking God to preserve her undefiled. When they entered the house, Euphrasia asked the barbarian to wait so she could to give him a plant with miraculous power.“If you wear the sprout on your person, no one can harm you,” she said. When he said, “Give it to me later,\" Euphrasia replied, “The plant is powerless if touched by a woman who has lost her virginity.\" The barbarian agreed to let Euphrasia go into the garden, so she went, broke off a sprig and showed it to him. He asked her, “How will I know if you are telling the truth?” Euphrasia placed the sprig against her neck and said, “Strike my neck with a sword as hard as you can and you will not hurt me.” The barbarian fetched a sword, and brought it down with all his might - decapitating Euphrasia. Too late, he realized he had been outwitted. The wise virgin, who preferred death rather than defilement, was welcomed into paradise by her Bridegroom, Jesus Christ.</p>"

As many as seven times?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.<br />That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.<br />When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.<br />Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.<br />At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'<br />Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.<br />When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount. He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, 'Pay back what you owe.'<br />Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'<br />But he refused. Instead, he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt.<br />Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.<br />His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant!

Her parents placed her in the monastery of Erford when she was very young, where her grandmother, Maud, was the abbess. Princess Matilde remained in the house and grew in virtues until her parents married her to Henry, son of Otho, Duke of Saxony, in 913, who was afterwards chosen king of Germany. He was a pious man, a victorious prince and a benevolent ruler. While Henry repelled the incursions of the Hungarians and Danes, and enlarged his dominions by adding Bavaria, Queen Matilde gained domestic victories over spiritual enemies, which was deeply pleasing to God. She nourished the seeds of devotion and humility in her heart through regular prayer and meditation. Queen Matilde delighted in visiting and comforting the sick and afflicted. She also served and counseled the poor, and was a helper and advocate for prisoners. King Henry, edified by her example, concurred with her in every pious undertaking. After twenty-three years' marriage, God called King Henry to Himself in 936. Queen Matilde went to church pouring forth her soul in prayer at the foot of the altar. When she understood, by the tears and cries of the people, that King Henry had expired, she asked for a priest; and fasted to offer the holy sacrifice for her husband's soul. Queen Matilde had three sons: Otho, afterwards emperor; Henry, Duke of Bavaria; and St. Brunn, Archbishop of Cologne. Otho was crowned king of Germany in 937, and emperor at Rome in 962, after his victories over the Bohemians and Lombards. The two oldest sons conspired to strip Queen Matilde of her dowry on the unjust pretence that she had squandered the revenues of the state on the poor. The unnatural princes later repented of their injustice and restored all her wealth. She then became more liberal in her alms than ever, and founded many churches, with five monasteries. In her last sickness, Queen Matilde made her confession to her grandson William, the Archbishop of Mentz, who passed away twelve days before her on the road home. She made a second public confession to the priests and monks, received the last sacraments a second time, and lying on a sack-cloth, with ashes on her head, passed away on March 14, 968.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leobinus()</h3><hr />"

Zachary came to be pope through his humility and abounding love for God. He loved the clergy and Roman people so dearly that he risked his life to save them during the rebellion of the Dukes of Spoleto and Benevento against King Luitprand. Out of respect for Pope Zachary's selflessness and goodness, the king restored all the Church's properties and sent back the captives without ransom. Many Lombards were converted when Pope Zachary offered the Holy Mass and administered the sacraments. He also enacted wholesome regulations that settled the discipline and peace of several churches. St. Boniface, the Apostle of Germany, appealed to Pope Zachary against a certain priest named Virgilius, who labored to sow the seeds of discord between him and Odilo, Duke of Bavaria. Pope Zachary ordered that Virgilius be sent to Rome to examine the latter's teaching and doctrine. It seems Virgilius cleared his name because he was later consecrated Bishop of Salzburg. When certain Venetian merchants brought slaves to Rome to sell to the Moors in Africa, Pope Zachary forbade the trafficking. He paid the merchants their price and set the slaves free. Pope Zachary also adorned Rome with sacred buildings, foundations for the poor and pilgrims, and gave a considerable sum every year for oil in the lamps of St. Peter's Church. Pope Zachary passed away in March 752.

She was educated by the Dominican nuns at Poissy. She desired to become a nun, but on the advice of her confessor, she married Antony LeGras, an official in the Queen's service, in 1613. After Antony's death in 1625, Louise met St. Vincent de Paul, who became her spiritual adviser. She devoted the rest of her life to working with him. She helped direct his Ladies of Charity in their work of caring for the sick, the poor and the neglected. In 1633, she set up a training center in her own home for candidates seeking to help in her work. This was the beginning of the Sisters (or Daughters, as Vincent preferred) of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul; though it was not formally approved until 1655. Sr. Louise took her vows in 1634 and attracted great numbers of candidates. She wrote a rule for the community, and in 1642, Vincent allowed four of the members to take vows. Formal approval placed the community under Vincent and his Congregation of the Missions, with Louise as Superior. Sr. Louise traveled all over France establishing her Sisters in hospitals, orphanages and other institutions. Since then, the Congregation has spread all over the world. St. Louise of Marillac wascanonized by Pope Pius XI in 1934, and was declared Patroness of Social Workers by Pope John XXIII in 1960.</p>"

He was educated in the school of Worms Cathedral and at the Benedictine Gorze Abbey in Lorraine, France. He returned to Worms Cathedral to be provost and was ordained in 994. In 994, Fr. Heribert was appointed chancellor of Italy by Otto III. In 998, Fr. Heribert was consecrated archbishop of Cologne. He became the chancellor of Germany that year as well, and served until Otto's passing on January 23, 1002. He also counselled Emperor St. Henry and mediated on the latter's behalf. Abp. Heribert built the monastery of Deutz on the Rhine and performed miracles. The miracle he is known for is ending a drought. He is the patron saint of farmers. Abp. Heribert passed away in Cologne on March 16, 1021, and was buried at Deutz. He was known for his unity of life and sanctity. St. Heribert was canonized by Pope St. Gregory VII around 1074.</p><hr /><h3>St. Abraham(Hermit & St. Mary (4th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ABRAHAM, Hermit (+ c. 360) and SAINT MARY (+ c. 355) St. Abraham was a rich nobleman of Edessa. At his parents' insistence, he married, but retired to a cell near the city after the feast. He walled up the door and left only a small window for food. Abraham lived in the cell for fifty years, worshiping God and imploring mercy for us sinners. After his parents' passing, he donated his inheritance to the poor. Many people received Abraham's advice and prayers. His devotion led to him being ordained a priest by the Bishop of Edessa. He was sent to an idolatrous city where priests were always rejected. For Jesus and the Gospel, Fr. Abraham was insulted, beaten, and banished three times, but he returned each time with grace and fervor. Fr. Abraham was zealous, and he expressed it in prayer, regular and liberating. Through his witness of Christ's teaching, Fr. Abraham baptized the city in three years. After work, Fr. Abraham would retire in his cell to speak intimately with God - convinced of the power of prayer to drive away evil. When Fr. Abraham's brother died, he left an only daughter, Mary. Fr. Abraham gave her a cell and raised her as his own daughter. After twenty years of innocence, Mary was deeply wounded through sin, and fled from God's mercy. Mary was separated from regularity and devotion in a distant city for two years. Fr. Abraham and St. Ephrem, who were seeking Mary, prayed for her return and exhausted every means possible. Venturing abroad, the two tracked down and consoled Mary, who cast herself upon the Lord. Jesus, the good shepherd, had retrieved and restored His lost sheep. While Mary received the gift of miracles, Fr. Abraham served the Church until his passing in 360. Mary passed away in 365. Her countenance after death shone like the sun. The Saints' neverending companionship continues with Jesus Christ in heaven</p><hr /><h3>St. Finnian Lobhar(Abbot (+ c. 560))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Finnian Lobhar Abbot(+ c. 560) St. Finnian was born in Bregia, Leinster, Ireland. He was ordained a priest by bishop Fathlad. Fr. Finnian's holiness, and the miracles obtained through his prayers, drew many Christians to seek his assistance. When the mother of a leprous boy came to him, he saw that he could only obtain the child's healing by taking the leprosy upon himself. Fr. Finnian accepted the condition and became leprous while the boy was cured. God is neither rigid nor transactional. Fr. Finnian was called Lobhar (\"the Leper\"), but healed others while carrying his cross. After serving in Clonmore, Fr. Finnian became abbot of Swords Abbey near Dublin. He may have returned to Clonmore in his later years. Tradition credits Fr. Finnian with founding a church at Innisfallen and a monastery there as well. He passed away around the year 350. St. Finnian awaits us in our true native land, where he prays and intercedes for us.</p>"

The Lord our God is Lord alone!<br />You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'<br />The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these.\"<br />The scribe said to him, \"Well said, teacher. You are right in saying, 'He is One and there is no other than he.'<br />And 'to love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself' is worth more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.\"<br />And when Jesus saw that (he) answered with understanding, he said to him, \"You are not far from the kingdom of God.\" And no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p><hr /><h3>St. Patrick(Bishop (c. 385-461))</h3><p>SAINT PATRICKBishop, Apostle of Ireland(c. 385-461) If the virtue of children reflects an honor on their parents, the name of St. Patrick is illumined by the countless lights of sanctity from the Church of Ireland, and by the Saints she sent to many foreign countries. St. Patrick was born toward the close of the fourth century, in a village called Bonaven Taberniæ, which seems to be the town of Kilpatrick, on the mouth of the river Clyde, in Scotland, between Dumbarton and Glasgow. He calls himself both a Briton and a Roman, or of a mixed extraction, and says his father was from a good family named Calphurnius, and a denizen of a neighboring city of the Romans, who not long after abandoned Britain in 409. Some writers call his mother Conchessa, and say she was a niece of St. Martin of Tours. When he was sixteen, Patrick was kidnapped, taken to Ireland and forced to tend cattle in the mountains and forests. Starving and naked, God pitied Patrick, and quickened him by the impulse of a strong interior grace. Through prayer and fasting, Patrick depended on God, and \"walked by faith, not by sight.\" After six years under one master, God told Patrick in a dream to return to Scotland. Knowing a ship was about to leave, Patrick went to the coast and found the vessel. However, he could not pay the fare and was denied passage. When Patrick started to return, praying as he went, the sailors called him back and took him on board. After three days’ sail, they made land, but wandered twenty-seven days through deserts. Finding nothing to eat, they began starving. Patrick had often preached about the infinite power of God, so the crew asked him why there was no relief. Animated by a strong faith, Patrick assured the crew that if they would address themselves with their whole hearts to Jesus Christ, He would hear and succor them. They did so, and on the same day encountered a herd of swine. A couple of years after returning to Scotland, Patrick was kidnapped again. This time, he escaped after two months. In Scotland with his parents, God revealed the convertion of Ireland through visions. In response, Patrick travelled to Gaul and Italy, met St. Martin and St. Germanus, and received his apostolical benediction from Pope Celestine. He spent many years preparing for the sacred calling. He encountered opposition from his relatives and the clergy. Some were against his episcopal consecration, his mission to evangelize, or both. Fr. Patrick left his family and all personal interest to serve strangers. In the the character and disposition of Christ, Fr. Patrick went to Ireland and preached the Gospel where idolatry and paganism were commonplace. The fruit of his prayer, preaching and work was the baptism of multitudes. Everywhere, Fr. Patrick ordained clergymen, induced married and unmarried people to live chaste, guilt-free lives, nurtured religious vocations and founded monasteries. Bp. Patrick did not accept payment or money from any of the people he baptized. The workers of the Catholic Church historically founded many centers of higher learning, and this took place organically in St. Patrick's Ireland. He gave from his own means to both pagan and Christian families, distributed alms to the poor, gave presents to kings for the progress of the Gospel, and sponsored and educated many children. The happy success of Bp. Patrick's labors also drew many persecutions. A prince named Corotick plundered the country where Bp. Patrick had confirmed many neophytes. When Corotick attacked, many were wearing their white baptismal garments. Corotick massacred some and enslaved others, selling them to the Picts or Scots. Bp. Patrick sent Corotick a letter to restore the captives and some of the loot so they would not starve, but the request was rebuffed. Bp. Patrick wrote again, said he too was a sinner, and declared that Corotick and the other parricides and accomplices were separated from Jesus Christ and the Church until they freed the captives. Bp. Patrick expressed love for his flock, grief for those who had been slain, and consolation for the martyrs. Jocelin writes that Corotick was eventually overtaken by divine justice. Bp. Patrick held several councils to settle the discipline of the Church he planted. St. Bernard and the tradition of the country testify that Bp. Patrick fixed his metropolitan see at Armagh. He established some other bishops, as appears by his Council, and other monuments. He not only converted the whole country through prayer, work and preaching, but also cultivated the vineyard with a benediction and increase from heaven: rendering Ireland a flourishing garden in the Church of God and a country of saints. Many particulars are related about the labors of St. Patrick, which we pass over. In the first year of his mission, he attempted to preach Christ in the general assembly of the kings and states of all Ireland, held yearly at Tara. It was the residence of the chief king or monarch of the whole island, and the principal seat of the Druids. The son of Neill, the chief monarch, declared himself against Fr. Patrick. Therefore, the latter converted several others and pronounced St. Benignus' father as an immediate successor. Fr. Patrick afterward converted and baptized the Icings of Dublin and Munster, and the seven sons of the king of Connaught, along with their subjects. He founded a monastery at Armagh; another called Domnach-Padraig, or Patrick's Church; also a third, named Sabhal-Padraig; and filled the country with churches and schools of piety and learning. Many of the universities drew foreigners to Ireland for the next three centuries. Bp. Patrick passed away and was buried at Down in Ulster. His body was found in a church of his name in 1185, and translated to another part of the same church. Glastonbury, Lindisfarne, Ripon and Malmesbury received the Catholic Faith thanks to Irish priests and bishops. Iona is now one of Scotland's main pilgrimage sites. Columban, Fiacre, Gall, and many others evangelized the rough places of France and Switzerland. America and Australia, in modern times, owe their faith to the sons and daughters of St. Patrick.</p>"

CYRIL OF JERUSALEMBishop and Doctor of the Church(+386) Cyril was born at or near Jerusalem around the year 315. He was ordained by St. Maximus, who gave him the important charge of instructing and preparing candidates for baptism. Cyril performed this duty for several years, and we still have one series of his instructions from the year 347 or 348. They are of singular interest as being the earliest record of the systematic teaching of the Church on the creed and sacraments, and as having been given in the church built by Constantine on Mount Calvary. They are solid, simple and profound; saturated with Holy Scripture; exact, precise, and terse; and, as a witness and exposition of the Catholic faith, invaluable. When St. Maximus passed away, Cyril was consecrated Bishop of Jerusalem in apostolic succession. At the beginning of his episcopate, a cross was seen in the air reaching from Mount Calvary to Mount Olivet, and so bright that it shone at noonday. Pope Cyril gave an account of it to the emperor, and the faithful regarded it as a presage of victory over the Arian heretics. Around this time, the apostate Julian resolved to falsify Jesus' words by rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem. He employed the power and resources of a Roman emperor. The Jews thronged enthusiastically and gave munificently. When the attempt was made, a secular writer tells us that flames came from the earth, rendering the place inaccessible to workmen. The attempt was made again and again, and then abandoned. Soon after, the emperor perished in a war against the Persians. Like the other great bishops of his time, Cyril was persecuted and driven again and again from his see; but on the death of the Arian Emperor Valens, he returned to Jerusalem. He was present at the second General Council at Constantinople; and passed away peacefully in 386, after a troubled episcopate of thirty-five years.</p>"

Fill your horn with oil, and be on your way. I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem, for I have chosen my king from among his sons.\"<br />As they came, he looked at Eliab and thought, \"Surely the LORD'S anointed is here before him.\"<br />But the LORD said to Samuel: \"Do not judge from his appearance or from his lofty stature, because I have rejected him. Not as man sees does God see, because man sees the appearance but the LORD looks into the heart.\"<br />In the same way Jesse presented seven sons before Samuel, but Samuel said to Jesse, \"The LORD has not chosen any one of these.\"<br />Then Samuel asked Jesse, \"Are these all the sons you have?\" Jesse replied, \"There is still the youngest, who is tending the sheep.\" Samuel said to Jesse, \"Send for him; we will not begin the sacrificial banquet until he arrives here.\"<br />Jesse sent and had the young man brought to them. He was ruddy, a youth handsome to behold and making a splendid appearance. The LORD said, \"There-anoint him, for this is he!\"<br />Then Samuel, with the horn of oil in hand, anointed him in the midst of his brothers; and from that day on, the spirit of the LORD rushed upon David.

Night is coming when no one can work.<br />While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.\"<br />When he had said this, he spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva, and smeared the clay on his eyes,<br />and said to him, \"Go wash in the Pool of Siloam\" (which means Sent). So he went and washed, and came back able to see.<br />His neighbors and those who had seen him earlier as a beggar said, \"Isn't this the one who used to sit and beg?\"<br />Some said, \"It is,\" but others said, \"No, he just looks like him.\" He said, \"I am.\"<br />So they said to him, \"(So) how were your eyes opened?\"<br />He replied, \"The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So I went there and washed and was able to see.\"<br />And they said to him, \"Where is he?\" He said, \"I don't know.\"<br />They brought the one who was once blind to the Pharisees.<br />Now Jesus had made clay and opened his eyes on a sabbath.<br />So then the Pharisees also asked him how he was able to see. He said to them, \"He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.\"<br />So some of the Pharisees said, \"This man is not from God, because he does not keep the sabbath.\" (But) others said, \"How can a sinful man do such signs?\" And there was a division among them.<br />So they said to the blind man again, \"What do you have to say about him, since he opened your eyes?\" He said, \"He is a prophet.\"<br />Now the Jews did not believe that he had been blind and gained his sight until they summoned the parents of the one who had gained his sight.<br />They asked them, \"Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How does he now see?\"<br />His parents answered and said, \"We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.<br />We do not know how he sees now, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him, he is of age; he can speak for him self.\"<br />His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone acknowledged him as the Messiah, he would be expelled from the synagogue.<br />For this reason his parents said, \"He is of age; question him.\"<br />So a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, \"Give God the praise! We know that this man is a sinner.\"<br />He replied, \"If he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know is that I was blind and now I see.\"<br />So they said to him, \"What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?\"<br />He answered them, \"I told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?\"<br />They ridiculed him and said, \"You are that man's disciple; we are disciples of Moses!<br />We know that God spoke to Moses, but we do not know where this one is from.\"<br />The man answered and said to them, \"This is what is so amazing, that you do not know where he is from, yet he opened my eyes.<br />We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if one is devout and does his will, he listens to him.<br />It is unheard of that anyone ever opened the eyes of a person born blind.<br />If this man were not from God, he would not be able to do anything.\"<br />They answered and said to him, \"You were born totally in sin, and are you trying to teach us?\" Then they threw him out.<br />When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, he found him and said, \"Do you believe in the Son of Man?\"<br />He answered and said, \"Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"You have seen him and the one speaking with you is he.\"<br />He said, \"I do believe, Lord,\" and he worshiped him.<br />Then Jesus said, \"I came into this world for judgment, so that those who do not see might see, and those who do see might become blind.\"<br />Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him, \"Surely we are not also blind, are we?\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you are saying, 'We see,' so your sin remains.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Marcel Callo (1921-1945)()</h3><p>Blessed Marcel Callo (1921-1945) Marcel Callo was born on December 6, 1921, in Rennes, France, being one of nine children. He was a happy child, known to be a leader and a perfectionist. After completing his primary studies, he became an apprentice to a printer around age thirteen. He belonged to the JOC (Young Christian Worker). On March 8, 1943, World War II had gripped their city of Rennes. That day, his sister Madeleine was killed by one of the bombs that leveled her building. When the Nazis later occupied France, Marcel was deported to Zella-Mehlis, Nazi Germany, to the S.T.O. (Service of Obligatory Work). If he did not comply, his family would be arrested, so he went. Once there, he worked in a factory that produced bombs. After three months or so of missing his family and missing Mass (there was no Catholic church in that town), Marcel became very depressed. He later found a room where Mass was offered on Sunday. This helped, and he reported: \"Finally Christ reacted. He made me to understand that the depression was not good. I had to keep busy with my friends and then joy and relief would come back to me.\" With his morale and hope restored, Marcel acted for his deported friends. He organized a group of Christian workers who did activities together like play sports or cards. He also organized a theatrical group. He galvanized his friends despite suffering from painful boils, headaches and infected teeth. For his French friends, he arranged a Mass to be celebrated in their native tongue. Eventually, his religious activities attracted unwanted attention from Nazi officials. The Nazis arrested Marcel on April 19, 1944. The Nazis interrogated Marcel. He admitted his Catholic activities and was imprisoned in Gotha. He secretly received the Eucharist while in prison and continued to pray and help his companions. He was considered dangerous to the Nazis and was moved to a different prison at Mathausen. He suffered from various ailments such as bronchitis, malnutrition, dysentery, fever, swelling and generalized weakness. He never complained. Despite his suffering, he encouraged his companions by saying, \"It is in prayer that we find our strength.\" Bl. Marcel Callo passed away on the feast of St. Joseph, March 19, 1945. Pope John Paul II beatified him on October 4, 1987.</p>"

The following year, he became a professor of Dogmatic Theology at the John Casimir University of Leopoli. He also served as Dean of Theology prior to becoming Rector of the University. During his tenure at the University, he was appreciated by his students and enjoyed the friendship and respect of his colleagues. He arduously dedicated himself to scientific work and, despite his young age, acquired notoriety as a learned man. Fr. Joseph's extraordinary intellectual and relational abilities were recognized by Francis Joseph, the Emperor of Austria, who presented Monsignor Joseph to the Holy Father as a candidate for the vacant Metropolitan See of Leopoli. The holy father, Leo XIII, responded positively to the Emperor's proposal; and on December 17, 1900, he named the forty year old Monsignor Joseph Bilczewski Archbishop of Leopoli of the Latin Rite.Given the complex social, economic, ethnic and religious situation, care for the large diocese required of the Bishop a deep commitment and called for great moral effort, strong confidence in God and a faith enlivened by a continual contact with God. Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski became known for his abundant goodness of heart, understanding, humility, piety, commitment to hard work and pastoral zeal which sprang from his immense love for God and neighbor. His pastoral plan can be summed up in the words, \"totally sacrifice oneself for the Holy Church.\" Among other things, he pointed out the need for the development of devotion to the Most Blessed Sacrament and frequent reception of Holy Communion. A particular form of pastoral action of Archbishop Bilczewski were the pastoral letters and appeals addressed to the priests and the faithful of the Archdiocese. In them, he spoke of the problems of faith and morals of the time as well as of the most pressing issues of the social sphere. He also explained devotion to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart and the importance of religious and moral formation of children and youth in the family and in school. He taught for the Church and for the Holy Father. Above all, he took great care to cultivate many priestly vocations. He saw the priest as first and foremost a teacher of faith and an instrument of Christ, a father for the rich as well as for the poor. Taking the place of Christ on Earth, the priest was to be the minister of the Sacraments, and for this reason his whole heart had to be dedicated to the celebration of the Eucharist, nourishing the people of God with the body of Christ (Jn 6:55). He often exhorted the priests to adoration of the most Blessed Sacrament. In his pastoral letter devoted to the Eucharist, he invited the priests to participate in the priestly associations: The Association for Perpetual Adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament and the Association of Aid to Poor Catholic Churches whose goal was to rejuvenate the zeal of the priests themselves. He also dedicated a great deal of care to the preparation of children and to full participation in the Mass, desiring that every Catechesis would lead children and youth to the Eucharist. Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski promoted the construction of churches and chapels, schools and day-care centers. He developed teaching to help enable the growth in the instruction of the faithful. He materially and spiritually helped the more important works that sprung up in his Archdiocese. His holy life, filled with prayer, good deeds and works of mercy led to his meriting great appreciation and respect on the part of those of various faiths, rites and nationalities present in the Archdiocese. No religious or nationalistic conflicts arose during the tenure of his pastoral work. He was a proponent of unity, harmony and peace. On social issues, he always stood on the side of the people and of the poor. He taught that the base of social life had to be justice made perfect by Christian love. During the First World War, when souls were overtaken with hate and a lack of appreciation of the other, he pointed out to the people the infinite love of God, capable of forgiving every type of sin and offense. He reminded them of the need to observe the commandments of God and particularly that of brotherly love. Sensitive to the social questions regarding the family and youth, he courageously proposed solutions to problems based on the love of God and of neighbor. During his 23 years of pastoral service, he changed the face of the Archdiocese of Leopoli. His passing on March 20, 1923, only brought new life to his vast and far-sighted pastoral action. He was prepared for death and accepted it with peace and serenity as a sign of God's will, which he always considered sacred.He left this world universally recognized for his holiness. Wanting to rest among those for whom he was always father and protector, in accord with his desires, he was buried in Leopoli in the cemetery of Janów, known as the cemetery of the poor. Thanks to the efforts of the Archdiocese of Leopoli, the process for his beatification and canonization was initiated. The first step was concluded on December 17, 1997, with the declaration of the life of heroic virtue of Archbishop Joseph Bilczewski by The Holy Father, Pope John Paul II. In June 2001, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints recognized as miraculous the fact of the rapid lasting and unexplainable \"quo ad modum\" healing through the intercession of Archbishop Bilczewski of the third degree burns of Marcin Gawlik, a nine year old boy, thus opening the way for his beatification.The beatification took place in the Diocese of Leopoli on June 26, 2001, during Pope John Paul II's Apostolic Visit to the Ukraine.He was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 23, 2005, at Rome.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maria Josefa of the Heart of Jesus((1842-1912))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MARIA JOSEFA OF THE HEART OF JESUS SANCHO DE GUERRA Religious (1842-1912)I- LIFE AND WORKS Saint Maria Josefa of the Heart of Jesus, eldest daughter of Bernabe Sancho, chair-maker, and of Petra de Guerra, housewife, was born in Vitoria (Spain) on September 7, 1842, and was baptized the following day. According to the custom practiced then, she was confirmed two years after, on August 10, 1844. Her father died when she was seven years old; her mother prepared her for the First Communion that she received at ten years old. At the age of fifteen, she was sent to some relatives in Madrid to receive education and a more complete formation. The characteristic traits of her infancy and childhood were: a strong piety to the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary, a remarkable sensibility towards the poor and the sick, and an inclination to solitude.She returned to Vitoria at the age of eighteen and manifested to her mother the desire to enter in a monastery, feeling an attraction to the cloistered life. From adulthood, Blessed Maria Josefa used to repeat: \"I was born with a religious vocation.\" She lived through many various experiences, but listened faithfully to counsel from both priests and family before finding the definitive form of her vocation. She was, in fact, to be on the point of entering to the Conceptionists contemplative of Aranjuez in 1860, but was prevented by the onset of a severe case of typhus. Her mother helped her to overcome the disappointment. In the succeeding months, it seemed to her understanding that the Lord calls her to a type of religious active life. For this, she decided to enter in the Institute of the Servants of Mary, recently founded in Madrid by Saint Soledad Torres Acosta. With the coming of the time of her profession, she was assailed with grave doubts and uncertainty on her effective call in that Institute. She opened her soul to various confessors and from their advices she felt that she was mistaken on her vocation. The meetings with the holy Archbishop Claret and the serene conversations Saint Soledad Torres Acosta helped Sr. Maria Josefa arrive to the decision of leaving the Institute of the Servants of Mary and founding a new religious family. The aim was to assist the sick in the hospitals and in their homes. With the Cardinal Archbishop of Toledo's permission, Sr. Maria Josefa and thee other Servants of Mary started the new foundation. The new foundation started in Bilbao in the spring of 1871, when Sr. Maria Josefa was twenty nine. Since then, and for the succeeding forty one years, she was superior of the new Institute of the Servants of Jesus. She embarked on difficult trips to visit the different communities until a long sickness confined her in the house of Bilbao. Obliged to stay in bed or an armchair, she continued to follow the events of the various communities with in and outside Spain through a painstaking and precious correspondence. When she passed away on March 20, 1912, after long years of suffering, there were 43 houses of the Servants of Jesus and the number of her Sisters reached more than one thousand. Her passing was felt in Bilbao and other numerous localities of the Institute. In the same way, her funeral had an extraordinary resonance. She was buried in the municipal cemetery of Bilbao. In 1926, her fame of sanctity grew and her mortal remains were transferred to the chapel of the Institute's mother house.II- SPIRITUALITY The writings and the testimonies of the eye-witnesses put in evidence the central points of the spirituality of Blessed Maria Josefa:1) Great love to the Eucharist and to the Sacred Heart.2) Profound adoration to the mystery of Redemption and intimate participation to the sufferings of Christ and to his Cross.3) Total dedication to the service of the sick in a context of contemplative spirit. Here are some significant expressions taken from her writings: \"The charity and mutual love constitute even in this life the paradise of the community. Without cross we cannot live wherever we go, because the religious life is a life of sacrifice and of abnegation. The foundation of greatest perfection is the fraternal charity\" (Don Pablo B. Aristegui, Beata Maria Josefa del Cuore di Gesù, Mensajero, Bilbao, 1992, p. 97). \"Don't believe sisters that the assistance consists only in giving medicines and food to the sick. There is another type of assistance that must never be forgotten and it is the assistance of the heart that adjusts and enter in sympathy with the person who suffers and go to meet his necessities\" (Ibidem, p. 100). \"We form in the Divine Heart of Jesus our center to communicate with Him. We can do it with the frequency that we desire without fear of molesting anyone; only with Jesus will be our intimacy'' (Consejos y Maximas de Nuestra Venerada Madre Fundadora. Madrid, Imprenta Juan Bravo, 1994, p. 15).III- CHARISM TO SERVE THE SICK The particular footprint imprinted by Ma. Josefa to the Institute of the Servants of Jesus reflects her interior experience of a soul consecrated to the charitable service of the neighbor, especially to the sick, in a climate of contemplative spirit. We find her concept well-expressed in the Directorio de Asistencias, where the Servant of Jesus provides for the sick, accompanies the suffering until the door of eternity, and calls those who are lost to the right path of life. \"In this manner, as written in the functional manuals of our Institute, designed to procure the corporal health of the neighbor, is elevated to a great height, making our active life more perfect than that of a contemplative, as taught by the angelic teacher St. Thomas who says about the works directed to the salvation of souls derived from contemplation\" (Directorio de Asistencias de la Congregación Religiosas Siervas de Jesús de la Caridad, Vitoria, 1930, p. 9). With this spirit, the Servants of Jesus, from the death of their Mother Maria Josefa and until now, have continued their service to the sick, with a generous oblation of life that reminds us of their Foundress. Furthermore, in conformity to the progress of times and the necessities of the modern life, from the primary end of the assistance to the sick, the assistance to old persons in residences and the reception and assistance to the children in day care centers, some others were added, such as: provision of food to the indigents, centers for those afflicted with AIDS, day care centers for the aged, pastoral health care and other works of beneficence and charities, above all in the poorest places of Latin America and Asia. Today, in actuality, the 1,050 Religious of the Institute of the Servants of Jesus are present in Spain and in other countries such as Italy, France, Portugal, Chile, Argentina, Columbia, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Dominican Republic, Paraguay and Philippines.IV- ITINERARY OF THE CAUSE Few years after the death of Mother Maria Josefa, the Institute of the Servants of Jesus planned to start the Cause of the Canonization. However, the adverse circumstances from the Spanish civil war and the Second World War delayed the motion.a) May 31, 1951, was the start of the Informative Ordinary Process in Bilbao.b) On January 7, 1972, the Decretum super introductione Causae.c) On September 7, 1989, the Decretum super Virtutibus was promulgated.d) On September 27, 1992, Ma. Maria Josefa was solemnly beatified in Saint Peter's Square.e) On October 1, 2000, she was canonized by John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Wulfran(Archbishop (+720))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT WULFRAN Archbishop(+720) St. Wulfran's father was an officer in the armies of King Dagobert. Wulfran spent some years in the court of King Clotaire III and St. Bathildes, the king's mother. Wulfran was humble and devoted to Jesus Christ and Mama Mary. Through prayer and the Sacraments, he learned to overcome concupiscence and the vanities of the world. Wulfran wasconsecrated Archbishop of Sens in 682. He governed the diocese for two and a half years. A tender compassion for the blindness of idolaters in Friesland, and the example of zealous English preachers, moved him to resign his bishopric. He attended a retreat at Fontenelle and entered Friesland as a poor missionary priest. Wulfran baptized multitudes, among them a son of King Radbod, and ended the custom of sacrificing people to idols. On one occasion, Ovon was selected as a sacrificial victim, but his life was spared when Wulfran begged King Radbod's mercy. People ran to the palace, and some would not suffer what they called a sacrilege. After many words, they backed down, but on the condition that Wulfran's God should save Ovon's life. Ovon, after being hanged on the gibbet two hours and being left for dead, fell to the ground when the cord broke. Found alive, Ovon was given to Wulfran, became a monk, and later a priest at Fontenelle. Wulfran also miraculously rescued two children from being drowned in honor of idols. Radbod, an eye-witness to Wulfran's miracle, promised to become Christian; but before stepping into the baptismal font, asked where the great number of his ancestors and nobles were in the afterlife. The prince then refused baptism and passed away before St. Willibrord could speak with him. Shortly after, Wulfran retired to Fontenelle, and passed away on April 20, 720.</p>"

Now that day was a sabbath.<br />So the Jews said to the man who was cured, \"It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat.\"<br />He answered them, \"The man who made me well told me, 'Take up your mat and walk.'\"<br />They asked him, \"Who is the man who told you, 'Take it up and walk'?\"<br />The man who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away, since there was a crowd there.<br />After this Jesus found him in the temple area and said to him, \"Look, you are well; do not sin any more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.\"<br />The man went and told the Jews that Jesus was the one who had made him well.<br />Therefore, the Jews began to persecute Jesus because he did this on a sabbath.</p><hr /><h3>St. Benedetta Cambiagio Frassinello (1791-1858)()</h3><p>SAINT BENEDETTA CAMBIAGIO FRASSINELLO (1791 - 1858) Saint Benedetta Cambiagio Frasinello was born on 2 October 1791 in Langasco (Genoa) Italy. She let the Holy Spirit guide her through married life to the work of education and religious consecration. She founded a school for the formation of young women and also a religious congregation, and did both with the generous collaboration of her husband. This is unique in the annals of Christian sanctity. Benedetta was a pioneer in her determination to give a high quality education to young women, for the formation of families for a \"new Christian society\" and for promoting the right of women to a complete education.Call to marriage, then to religious life From her parents, Benedetta received a Christian formation and a living faith. They raised her in Pavia when she was little. When Benedetta was twenty, she had a mystical experience that gave her a profound desire for a life of prayer and penance, and of consecration to God. However, in obedience to the wishes of her parents, in 1816, she married Giovanni Frassinello in obedience to her parents. They married in 1816, but agreed to live chastely as brother and sister. They took care of Benedetta's younger sister, Maria, who was dying from intestinal cancer. They began living a supernatural parenthood quite unique in the history of the Church.Congregation founded by wife, who is supported by her husband When Maria passed in 1825, Giovanni entered the Somaschi Fathers founded by St. Jerome Emiliani, and Benedetta in the Ursuline Congregation of Capriolo. A year later she was forced to leave because ofill health, and returned to Pavia where she was miraculously cured by St. Jerome Emiliani. With the Bishop's approval, Benedetta dedicated herself to educating younggirls. She needed help in handling such a responsibility, but her father refused to help. Bishop Tosi of Pavia asked Giovanni to leave the Somaschi novitiate and help Benedetta in her apostolic work. Together, they made a vow of perfect chastity in the hands of the bishop, and then began their common work to promote the human and Christian formation of poor and abandoned girls of the city. Benedetta became the first woman involved in this kind of work. The Austrian government recognized her as a \"Promoter of Public Education\". Sr. Benedetta was helped by young women volunteers to whom she gave a rule of life that later received ecclesiastical approval. Along with instruction, she joined formation in catechesis and in useful skills like cooking and sewing, aiming to transform her students into \"models of Christian life\" and so assure the formation of families.Benedictine Sisters of Providence Benedetta's work was considered pioneering for those days and was opposed by a few persons in power and by the misunderstanding of clerics. In 1838, she turned over the institution to the Bishop of Pavia. Together with Giovanni and five companions, she moved to Ronco Scrivia in the Genoa region. There they opened a school for girls that was a refinement on what they had done in Pavia. Eventually, Benedetta founded the Congregation of the Benedictine Sisters of Providence. In her rule, she stressed the education of young girls. She instilled the spirit of unlimited confidence and abandonment to Providence and of love of God through poverty and charity. The Congregation grew quickly since it performed a needed service. Benedetta was able to guide the development of the Congregation until her death. On March 21, 1858, she passed away in Ronco Scrivia. Today the Benedictine Nuns of Providence are present in Italy, Spain, Burundi, Ivory Coast, Peru and Brazil. They are at the service of young people, the poor, the sick and the elderly. The foundress also opened a house of the order in Voghera. Forty years after the death of Benedetta, the bishop separated this house from the rest of the Order. The name was changed to the Benedictines of Divine Providence who honour the memory of the Foundress. Bemedetta was canonized by John Paul II on May 19, 2002.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euda()</h3><hr />"

Cardinal August von Galen(Bishop (1933-1946))</h3><p>Blessed Clemens August von GalenBishop of Münster (1878-1946) Clemens August von Galen was born on 16 March 1878 in Dinklage Castle, Oldenburg, Germany, the 11th of 13 children born to Count Ferdinand Heribert and Elisabeth von Spees. His father belonged to the noble family of Westphalia, who since 1660 governed the village of Dinklage. For over two centuries his ancestors carried out the inherited office of camerlengo of the Diocese of Münster. Clemens August grew up in Dinklage Castle and in other family seats. Due to the struggle between Church and State, he and his brothers were sent to a school run by the Jesuits in Feldkirch, Austria. He remained there until 1894, when he transferred to the Antonianum in Vechta. After graduation, he studied philosophy and theology in Frebur, Innsbruck and Münster, and was ordained a priest on 28 May 1904 for the Diocese of Münster by Bishop Hermann Dingelstadt.Parish priest, concern for poor His first two years as a priest were spent as vicar of the diocesan cathedral where he became chaplain to his uncle, Bishop Maximilian Gerion von Galen. From 1906 to 1929, Fr von Galen carried out much of his pastoral activity outside Münster: in 1906 he was made chaplain of the parish of St Matthias in Berlin-Schönberg; from 1911 to 1919 he was curate of a new parish in Berlin before becoming parish priest of the Basilica of St Matthias in Berlin-Schönberg, where he served for 10 years; here, he was particularly remembered for his special concern for the poor and outcasts. In 1929, Fr von Galen was called back to Münster when Bishop Johannes Poggenpohlaskedhimtoserveas parish priest of the Church of St Lambert.\"Nec laudibus, nec timore' In January 1933, Bishop Poggenpohl died, leaving the See vacant. After two candidates refused, on September 5, 1933 Fr Clemens was appointed Bishop of Münster by Pope Pius XI. On October 28, 1933 he was consecrated by Cardinal Joseph Schulte, Archbishop of Cologne; Bishop von Galen was the first diocesan Bishop to be consecrated under Hitler's regime. As his motto, he chose the formula of the rite of episcopal consecration: \"Nec laudibus, nec timore\" (Neither praise nor threats will distance me from God). Throughout the 20 years that Bishop von Galen was curate and parish priest in Berlin, he wrote on various political and social issues; in a pastoral letter dated 26 March 1934, he wrote very clearly and critically on the \"neopaganism of the national socialist ideology\". Due to his outspoken criticism, he was called to Rome by Pope Pius XI in 1937 together with the Bishop of Berlin, to confer with them on the situation in Germany and speak of the eventual publication of an Encyclical. On 14 March 1937 the Encyclical \"Mit brennender Sorge\" (To the Bishops of Germany: The place of the Catholic Church in the German Reich) was published. It was widely circulated by Bishop von Galen, notwithstanding Nazi opposition.\"Lion of Munster' In the summer of 1941, in answer to unwarranted attacks by the National Socialists, Bishop von Galen delivered three admonitory sermons between July and August. He spoke in his old parish Church of St Lambert and in Liebfrauen-Ueberlassen Church, since the diocesan cathedral had been bombed. In his famous speeches, Bishop von Galen spoke out against the State confiscation of Church property and the programmatic euthanasia carried out by the regime. The clarity and incisiveness of his words and the unshakable fidelity of Catholics in the Diocese of Münster embarrassed the Nazi regime, and on 10 October 1943 the Bishop's residence was bombed. Bishop von Galen was forced to take refuge in nearby Borromeo College. From 12 September 1944 on, he could no longer remain in the city of Münster, destroyed by the war; he left for the zone of Sendenhorst. In 1945, Vatican Radio announced that Pope Pius XII was to hold a Consistory and that the Bishop of Münster was also to be present.Creation of a Cardinal After a long and difficult journey, due to the war and other impediments, Bishop von Galen finally arrived in the \"Eternal City\". On 21 February 1946 the Public Consistory was held in St Peter's Basilica and Bishop von Galen was created a Cardinal. On 16 March 1946 the 68-year-old Cardinal returned to Münster. He was cordially welcomed back by the city Authorities and awarded honorary citizenship by the burgomaster. On the site of what remained of the cathedral, Cardinal von Galen gave his first (and what would be his last) discourse to the more than 50,000 people who had gathered, thanking them for their fidelity to the then-Bishop of Münster during the National Socialist regime. He explained that as a Bishop, it was his duty to speak clearly and plainly about what was happening. No one knew that the Cardinal was gravely ill, and when he returned to Münster on 19 March 1946 he had to undergo an operation. Cardinal von Galen died just three days later, on 22 March. He was buried on 28 March in the Ludgerus Chapel, which has become a place of pilgrimage to this defender of the faith in the face of political oppression.</p><hr /><h3>St. Nicholas Owen()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>St. Lea()</h3><hr />"

Let your blazing wrath die down; relent in punishing your people.<br />Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, and how you swore to them by your own self, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky; and all this land that I promised, I will give your descendants as their perpetual heritage.'\"<br />So the LORD relented in the punishment he had threatened to inflict on his people.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>106(105),19-20.21-22.23.</em><p>Our fathers made a calf in Horeb <br />and adored a molten image;<br />They exchanged their glory <br />for the image of a grass-eating bullock.<br />They forgot the God who had saved them, <br />who had done great deeds in Egypt,<br />Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, <br />terrible things at the Red Sea.<br />Then he spoke of exterminating them, <br />but Moses, his chosen one, <br />withstood him in the breach <br />to turn back his destructive wrath.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>5,31-47.</em><p>Jesus said to the Jews: \"If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not true.<br />But there is another who testifies on my behalf, and I know that the testimony he gives on my behalf is true.<br />You sent emissaries to John, and he testified to the truth.<br />I do not accept testimony from a human being, but I say this so that you may be saved.<br />He was a burning and shining lamp, and for a while you were content to rejoice in his light.<br />But I have testimony greater than John's. The works that the Father gave me to accomplish, these works that I perform testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.\"<br />Moreover, the Father who sent me has testified on my behalf. But you have never heard his voice nor seen his form,<br />and you do not have his word remaining in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he has sent.<br />You search the scriptures, because you think you have eternal life through them; even they testify on my behalf.<br />But you do not want to come to me to have life.<br />I do not accept human praise;<br />moreover, I know that you do not have the love of God in you.<br />I came in the name of my Father, but you do not accept me; yet if another comes in his own name, you will accept him.<br />How can you believe, when you accept praise from one another and do not seek the praise that comes from the only God?<br />Do not think that I will accuse you before the Father: the one who will accuse you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope.<br />For if you had believed Moses, you would have believed me, because he wrote about me.<br />But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Turibius of Mongrovejo(Bishop (1538-1606))</h3><p>SAINT TURIBIUS of MONGROVEJO Archbishop of Lima (1538-1606) Turibius Alphonsus Mongrovejo was born on November 6, 1538, at Mayorga, Kingdom of Leon, Spain. Raised by pious and virtuous parents, Turibius lived a blessed childhood. His leisure included spiritual exercises and reading. He was cheerful while doing works of charity. He also gave his body a little less than it asked for. Apart from denying self-gratification, Turibius made long pilgrimages on foot. Turibius' reputation as a master of canon and civil law reached the ears of King Philip II, who made him a judge at Granada. About that time, the see of Lima, Peru, fell vacant, and among those proposed, Philip II found no one who seemed better endowed than Turibius. The Roman Pontiff confirmed King Philip's appointment, and directed Turibius to receive Holy Orders and be consecrated. Yielding at last by direction of his confessor, Turibius was ordained a priest and consecrated. Bp. Turibius arrived at Lima in 1587. With humility and consistent effort, he edified the Christians and brought order to his episcopal city. He received confessions daily and prepared for Mass by long meditation. Bp. Turibius then began visiting his vast diocese, which he traversed three times. His first visitation lasted seven years, and his second four. He held provincial councils and framed decrees and regulations adopted in neighboring countries. Always acting for the common good, Bp. Turibius channeled nearly his entire revenue toward safety nets and uplifting the needy. While performing his duties during a third visitation, Bp. Turibius was seized with a fatal illness. He passed away on March 23, 1606, at Santa, exclaiming as he received the sacred Viaticum: \"I rejoiced in the things that were said to me: 'We shall go into the house of the Lord.'\"The proofs of his holy life and of the favors granted through his intercession led Pope Innocent XI to beatify him. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XIII in 1726.</p><hr /><h3>Sts Victorian and others(Martyrs (+ 484))</h3><hr /><p>STS. VICTORIAN AND OTHERS Martyrs (+ 484) Huneric, the Arian king of the Vandals in Africa, succeeded his father Genseric in 477. He moderated his behavior toward Catholics, but began persecuting the clergy and holy virgins in 480. The killings escalated into a general persecution in 484. Victorian, one of the principal lords of the kingdom, had been made governor of Carthage, with the Roman title of Proconsul. He was the wealthiest subject of the king and endowed with trust. The king's confidence came from Victorian's unwavering fidelity. The king, after publishing his edicts against Christianity, sent a message to the proconsul, promising wealth and honor if the latter conformed to the state religion. Victorian replied, \"Tell the king that I trust in Christ. His Majesty may condemn me to any torments, but I shall never consent to renounce the Catholic Church, in which I have been baptized. Even if there were no life after this, I would never be ungrateful and perfidious to God, Who has granted me the happiness of knowing Him...\" The tyrant, in retaliation, ordered Victorian tortured to the brink of death. Victorian suffered the torture courageously and with heroic charity. The Roman Martyrology joins Victorian with four others who were martyred on this day. Two brothers, who were arrested for the faith, had promised each other, if possible, to die together. The executioners hung them in the air using weights on their feet. Alban Butler writes, \"One brother, under the excess of pain, begged to be taken down for a brief pause. The other brother, fearing that relief might cause him to deny his faith, cried out, 'God forbid... Is that what we promised Jesus?' The brother was so encouraged that he cried out, \"No... Increase my tortures...\" They were then burned with red-hot plates of iron, and tormented so long that others received faith in God. Two merchants of Carthage, both named Frumentius, suffered martyrdom around the sane time. Another confessor, Liberatus, an eminent physician, was sent into banishment with his wife. The Roman Martyrologies also mention twelve young children who dragged away and violently separated from each other. They were cruelly beaten and scourged every day; yet all of them persevered in the faith to the end of the persecution.</p>"

He calls blest the destiny of the just and boasts that God is his Father.<br />Let us see whether his words be true; let us find out what will happen to him.<br />For if the just one be the son of God, he will defend him and deliver him from the hand of his foes.<br />With revilement and torture let us put him to the test that we may have proof of his gentleness and try his patience.<br />Let us condemn him to a shameful death; for according to his own words, God will take care of him.\"<br />These were their thoughts, but they erred; for their wickedness blinded them,<br />And they knew not the hidden counsels of God; neither did they count on a recompense of holiness nor discern the innocent souls' reward.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>34(33),17-18.19-20.21.23.</em><p>The LORD confronts the evildoers, <br />to destroy remembrance of them from the earth.<br />When the just cry out, the LORD hears them, <br />and from all their distress he rescues them.<br />The LORD is close to the brokenhearted; <br />and those who are crushed in spirit he saves.<br />Many are the troubles of the just man, <br />but out of them all the LORD delivers him.<br />He watches over all his bones; <br />not one of them shall be broken.<br />The LORD redeems the lives of his servants; <br />no one incurs guilt who takes refuge in him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>7,1-2.10.25-30.</em><p>Jesus moved about within Galilee; but he did not wish to travel in Judea, because the Jews were trying to kill him.<br />But the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near.<br />But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, he himself also went up, not openly but (as it were) in secret.<br />So some of the inhabitants of Jerusalem said, \"Is he not the one they are trying to kill?<br />And look, he is speaking openly and they say nothing to him. Could the authorities have realized that he is the Messiah?<br />But we know where he is from. When the Messiah comes, no one will know where he is from.\"<br />So Jesus cried out in the temple area as he was teaching and said, \"You know me and also know where I am from. Yet I did not come on my own, but the one who sent me, whom you do not know, is true.<br />I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.\"<br />So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand upon him, because his hour had not yet come.</p><hr /><h3>St. Catherine of Sweden (1330 + 1381)()</h3><p>SAINT CATHARINE OF SWEDEN Virgin(1331 + 1381) Catharine was the fourth child of St. Bridget and her husband Ulf Gudmarsson. She was born in 1331 or 1332. At the age of seven, she was sent to the abbess of the convent of Riseberg for schooling. Like her mother, Catharine mortified her senses and made time for spiritual development. At her father's behest, Catharine married Eggart von Kürnen when she was around fourteen. Eggart was very pious and morally upright. When she asked him to join her in a vow of chastity, Eggart immediately agreed. They lived in a state of virginity and devoted themselves to exercises of Christian perfection and active charity. Catharine once accompanied her mother to Rome where St. Bridget had gone in 1349. Soon after they arrived, Catharine received news that her husband had passed away in Sweden. She afterward lived with her mother and took an active part in St. Bridget's fruitful labors. Catharine also zealously imitated her mother's ascetic life. Although the distinguished and beautiful young widow was surrounded by suitors, she steadfastly refused all offers of marriage. In 1372, Catharine and her brother, Birger, accompanied their mother on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Upon their return, Catharine was with her mother during the latter's final illness and death. In 1374, in obedience to St. Bridget's wish, Catharine interred her mother's remains at Wadstena, Sweden, and became the head of the foundation. The motherhouse of the Brigittine Order was based there. It was also called the Order of St. Savior. Catharine managed the convent with great skill and harmony in accordance with the principles of the founder. Catharine passed away on March 24, 1381. For her heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from her intercession, St. Catharine was canonized. She lives and reigns in heaven forever alongside Jesus Christ and the saints.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Maria Karlowska (1865-1935)()</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Maria Karlowska Religious(1865-1935) Maria Karlowska was born in the territories under Prussian occupation in 1865. She worked as a true Samaritan among women suffering great material and moral deprivation. Her holy zeal quickly attracted a group of Christian disciples, with whom she founded the Congregation of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd of Divine Providence. For herself and her Sisters, she set the following goal: \"We must proclaim the Heart of Jesus, that is, so to live from him, in him and for him, as to become like him and that in our lives he may be more visible than we ourselves.\" Her devotion to the Savior's Sacred Heart bore fruit in a great love for people. She felt an insatiable hunger for love. A love of this kind, according to Blessed Maria Karlowska, will never say \"enough,\" will never stop midway. Precisely this happened to her, who was, as it were transported by the current of love of the Divine Paraclete. Thanks to this love, she restored to many souls the light of Christ and helped them regain dignity.</p><hr /><h3>Saint Oscar Romero (1917 - 1980)()</h3><hr /><p>Saint Oscar Romero (1917 - , CardinalEarly lifeOscar Romero was born into a large family on August 15, 1917, in El Salvador. Although they had more money than many of their neighbors, Oscar’s family had neither electricity nor running water in their small home, and the children slept on the floor. Oscar’s parents could not afford to send him to school after the age of twelve, so he went to work as an apprentice carpenter. He quickly showed great skills, but Oscar was already determined to become a priest. He entered the seminary at the age of fourteen and was ordained a priest when he was twenty-five in 1942. Recognising the power of radio to reach the people, he convinced five radio stations to broadcast his Sunday sermons to peasant farmers who believed they were unwelcome in the churches.In 1970, he became Auxiliary Bishop in San Salvador. In 1974, he became Bishop of Santiago de Maria. At this time, Oscar Romero was described as a conservative, not wanting to break from tradition. He supported the hierarchy who encouraged conformity. He was uncomfortable with social action that challenged political leaders.Growing awarenessDuring his two years as Bishop of Santiago de Maria, Romero was horrified to find that children were dying because their parents could not pay for simple medicines. He began using the resources of the diocese and his own personal resources to help the poor, but he knew that simple charity was not enough. He wrote in his diary that people who are poor should not just receive handouts from the Church or the government, but participate in changing their lives for the future.In 1977, Romero became Archbishop of San Salvador, the capital city. The situation in El Salvador was becoming worseand he couldn’t remain silent any longer. The military were killing the Salvadorian people - especially those demandingjustice - such as teachers, nuns and priests, and including Romero’s good friend, Fr. Rutilio Grande. Thousands of people began to go missing. Romero demanded that the President of El Salvador thoroughly investigate the killings, but he failed to act.Voice of the voicelessIn his actions and words, Oscar demanded a peace that could only be found by ensuring people had access to basicneeds and their rights upheld. He raised awareness globally about the people in his country who had been killed or \"disappeared.\" When he visited the Vatican in 1979, Oscar Romero presented the Pope with seven detailed reports of murder, torture, and kidnapping throughout El Salvador.In 1979, the number of people being killed rose to more than 3000 per month. Oscar Romero had nothing left to offer his people except faith and hope. He continued to use the radio broadcast of his Sunday sermons to tell people what was happening throughout the country, to talk about the role of the Church and to offer his listeners hope that they would not suffer and die in vain.MartyrdomOn March 23, 1980, after reporting the previous week’s deaths and disappearances, Oscar Romero began to speak directly to soldiers and policemen: “I beg you, I implore you, I order you... in the name of God, stop the repression!” The following evening, while saying Mass in the chapel of Divine Providence Hospital, Archbishop Oscar Romero was shot by an assassin. Only moments before his death, Romero spoke these prophetic words: “Those who surrender to the service of the poor through love of Christ will live like the grain of wheat that dies… The harvest comes because of the grain that dies.” Like many great leaders who have fought for truth, Oscar Romero was killed and became a martyr, but his voice could not be silenced. He is a symbol of hope in a country that has suffered poverty, injustice and violence. As a saint, his intercession can be readily called upon for causes of justice and love for God.</p>"

It was a cave, and a stone lay across it.<br />Jesus said, \"Take away the stone.\" Martha, the dead man's sister, said to him, \"Lord, by now there will be a stench; he has been dead for four days.\"<br />Jesus said to her, \"Did I not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of God?\"<br />So they took away the stone. And Jesus raised his eyes and said, \"Father, I thank you for hearing me.<br />I know that you always hear me; but because of the crowd here I have said this, that they may believe that you sent me.\"<br />And when he had said this, he cried out in a loud voice, \"Lazarus, come out!\"<br />The dead man came out, tied hand and foot with burial bands, and his face was wrapped in a cloth.

His received education and spiritual formation from St. Gregory, St. Boniface's disciple. Ludger was educated in St. Gregory's monastery at Utrech. He also wore the clerical tonsure an. He reponded to the Holy Spirit's inner promptings by training for four and a half years with Alcuincin in a school at York. In 773, Ludger returned to Friesland. When St. Gregory passed away in 776, Ludger was ordained to the priestood. After his ordination, Fr. Ludger preached the Gospel in Friesland, where many hearts were converted. Providentially, he founded several monasteries and built several churches. When the pagan Saxons ravaged the country, Fr. Ludger travelled to Rome to consult Pope Adrian II. For preaching Jesus present to us in the sacraments (bodily form), Fr. Ludger was in danger if he returned. He then retired for three and a half years to Monte Casino, where he donned the habit of the Order and conformed to the practice of the rule. In 787, Charlemagne defeated the Saxons and conquered Friesland and the coast of the Germanic Ocean as far as Denmark. Fr. Ludger returned to East Friesland and converted the Saxons to the Faith, including the province of Westphalia. Fr. Ludger founded the monastery of Werden, twenty-nine miles from Cologne. In 802, Hildebald, the Archbishop of Cologne, consecrated Fr. Ludger to the Bishopric of Munster. Bp. Ludger afterward appointed five cantons from Friesland, and founded the Monastery of Helmstad in the duchy of Brunswick. When charges were brought against Bp. Ludger for wasting the Church's donations, he was summoned to court by Emperor Charlemagne. The chamberlain sent to him was told that Bp. Ludger would follow after prayer. By the time Bp. Ludger finished praying, Emperor Charlemagne grew emotional and said, \"Why did you make me wait so long?\" Bp. Ludger replied that his respect for his Majesty was profound, but God was infinitely above him. While we are occupied with Him, it is our duty to forget everything else. This answer, and Bp. Ludger's account of himself, made the Emperor dismiss the charges. St. Ludger was favored with the gifts of miracles and prophecy. His last sickness, though painful, did not hinder his daily activities. Up to the last day of his life, Passion Sunday, Bp. Ludger preached very early in the morning, said Mass towards nine, and preached again before night. He passed away on March 26, midnight, at the hour he foretold.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Maddalena Caterina Morano (1847-1908)()</h3><hr /><p>BLESSED MADDALENA CATERINA MORANO (1847-1908) Blessed Maddalena Caterina Morano was born in 1847 to a large family in Chieri, near Turin, Italy. When she was eight, her father and older sister passed away; and so young Maddalena had to work. However, she applied herself to studying as well, and in 1866, she received her diploma as an elementary school teacher. Maddalena's studies increased her knowledge of Christian doctrine and her longing to be a saint. She wished to enter religious life, but postponed it for the needs of her family. For twelve years, she worked as a rural school teacher in Montaldo and taught catechism in the local parish. In 1878, having set aside enough savings for her mother, Maddalena entered the Daughters of Mary Help of Christians, a congregation founded six years earlier by Don Bosco. She was a model religious, and after a brief but intense novitiate, took her first vows. In 1881, with Don Bosco's blessing, she was sent to Trecastagni (Diocese of Catania), Sicily, and put in charge of an existing institute for women, to which she gave a new orientation inspired by the principles of the Salesian method. Sicily became Mother Maddalena's second home, where she carried out a varied and fruitful apostolate. She opened new houses, set up after-school activities and sewing classes, trained teachers, and conducted apostolic activities. Her real love, though, was for catechism class, since she was convinced that the formation of Christian conscience was the basis of personal maturity and all social improvement. She coordinated catechetical instruction in eighteen of Catania's churches and trained lay and religious catechists. Mother Maddalena spent twenty-five years in Sicily and served her community as local and provincial superior. She was an attentive mother and cared for many local vocations, faithfully living the charism of Mother Maria Mazzarello, co-foundress of the institute. She passed away in Catania at the age of sixty-one, on March 26, 1908.She was beatified on November 5, 1994, at Catania, by Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Margaret Clitherow()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

She decided to bathe, for the weather was warm.<br />Nobody else was there except the two elders, who had hidden themselves and were watching her.<br />\"Bring me oil and soap,\" she said to the maids, \"and shut the garden doors while I bathe.\"<br />As soon as the maids had left, the two old men got up and hurried to her.<br />\"Look,\" they said, \"the garden doors are shut, and no one can see us; give in to our desire, and lie with us.<br />If you refuse, we will testify against you that you dismissed your maids because a young man was here with you.\"<br />\"I am completely trapped,\" Susanna groaned. \"If I yield, it will be my death; if I refuse, I cannot escape your power.<br />Yet it is better for me to fall into your power without guilt than to sin before the Lord.\"<br />Then Susanna shrieked, and the old men also shouted at her,<br />as one of them ran to open the garden doors.<br />When the people in the house heard the cries from the garden, they rushed in by the side gate to see what had happened to her.<br />At the accusations by the old men, the servants felt very much ashamed, for never had any such thing been said about Susanna.<br />When the people came to her husband Joakim the next day, the two wicked elders also came, fully determined to put Susanna to death. Before all the people they ordered:<br />\"Send for Susanna, the daughter of Hilkiah, the wife of Joakim.\" When she was sent for,<br />she came with her parents, children and all her relatives.<br />All her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.<br />In the midst of the people the two elders rose up and laid their hands on her head.<br />Through her tears she looked up to heaven, for she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.<br />The elders made this accusation: \"As we were walking in the garden alone, this woman entered with two girls and shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.<br />A young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.<br />When we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime, we ran toward them.<br />We saw them lying together, but the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we; he opened the doors and ran off.<br />Then we seized this one and asked who the young man was,<br />but she refused to tell us. We testify to this.\" The assembly believed them, since they were elders and judges of the people, and they condemned her to death.<br />But Susanna cried aloud: \"O eternal God, you know what is hidden and are aware of all things before they come to be:<br />you know that they have testified falsely against me. Here I am about to die, though I have done none of the things with which these wicked men have charged me.\"<br />The Lord heard her prayer.<br />As she was being led to execution, God stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,<br />and he cried aloud: \"I will have no part in the death of this woman.\"<br />All the people turned and asked him, \"What is this you are saying?\"<br />He stood in their midst and continued, \"Are you such fools, O Israelites! To condemn a woman of Israel without examination and without clear evidence?<br />Return to court, for they have testified falsely against her.\"<br />Then all the people returned in haste. To Daniel the elders said, \"Come, sit with us and inform us, since God has given you the prestige of old age.\"<br />But he replied, \"Separate these two far from one another that I may examine them.\"<br />After they were separated one from the other, he called one of them and said: \"How you have grown evil with age! Now have your past sins come to term:<br />passing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent, and freeing the guilty, although the Lord says, \"The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.'<br />Now, then, if you were a witness, tell me under what tree you saw them together.\"<br />\"Under a mastic tree,\" he answered. \"Your fine lie has cost you your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him and split you in two.\"<br />Putting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought. \"Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah,\" Daniel said to him, \"beauty has seduced you, lust has subverted your conscience.<br />This is how you acted with the daughters of Israel, and in their fear they yielded to you; but a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.<br />Now, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.\"<br />\"Under an oak,\" he said. \"Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\" said Daniel; \"for the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two so as to make an end of you both.\"<br />The whole assembly cried aloud, blessing God who saves those that hope in him.<br />They rose up against the two elders, for by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury. According to the law of Moses, they inflicted on them the penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:<br />they put them to death. Thus was innocent blood spared that day.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>23(22),1-3a.3b-4.5.6.</em><p>The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.<br />In verdant pastures he gives me repose; <br />beside restful waters he leads me;<br />he refreshes my soul. <br />He guides me in right paths<br />for His names's sake.<br />Even though I walk in the dark valley <br />I fear no evil; for you are at my side <br />with your rod and your staff <br />that give me courage.<br />You spread the table before me <br />in the sight of my foes; <br />You anoint my head with oil; <br />my cup overflows.<br />Only goodness and kindness follow me <br />all the days of my life; <br />and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD <br />for years to come.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>8,1-11.</em><p>Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.<br />But early in the morning he arrived again in the temple area, and all the people started coming to him, and he sat down and taught them.<br />Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle.<br />They said to him, \"Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery.<br />Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women. So what do you say?\"<br />They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.<br />But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, \"Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\"<br />Again he bent down and wrote on the ground.<br />And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him.<br />Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, \"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\"<br />She replied, \"No one, sir.\" Then Jesus said, \"Neither do I condemn you. Go, (and) from now on do not sin any more.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. John of Egypt (+ 394)()</h3><p>SAINT JOHN OF EGYPT (+ 394) John worked with his father as a carpenter. When he was twenty-five, he answered his calling to be a solitary in the desert. As a disciple, John was tested with unreasonable commands, which included rolling heavy stones and tending dead trees. John succeeded, received a liberal education, and attained the heights of spiritual mastery. After sixteen years, John withdrew to the top of a steep cliff to contemplate God. He seldom entertained company, but was constantly aware of God's presence. In return for his perfect obedience to God, he was given authority over creatures. St. Augustine tells us that John appeared in a vision to a holy woman whose sight he cured. Devils conntinuouslly assailed him, but he never stopped prayng Through his time with God, John healed others and prophecied. When a deacon he had never met visited, John reverently kissed his hand. To the Emperor Theodosius, he foretold future victories and the time of death. The last three days of John's life were given to God. On the third day, he was found kneeling in prayer, but his soul was in heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Rupert of Salzburg()</h3><hr />"

But with their patience worn out by the journey,<br />the people complained against God and Moses, \"Why have you brought us up from Egypt to die in this desert, where there is no food or water? We are disgusted with this wretched food!\"<br />In punishment the LORD sent among the people saraph serpents, which bit the people so that many of them died.<br />Then the people came to Moses and said, \"We have sinned in complaining against the LORD and you. Pray the LORD to take the serpents from us.\" So Moses prayed for the people,<br />and the LORD said to Moses, \"Make a saraph and mount it on a pole, and if anyone who has been bitten looks at it, he will recover.\"<br />Moses accordingly made a bronze serpent and mounted it on a pole, and whenever anyone who had been bitten by a serpent looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>102(101),2-3.16-18.19-21.</em><p>LORD, hear my prayer; <br />let my cry come to you.<br />Do not hide your face from me <br />now that I am in distress. <br />Turn your ear to me; <br />when I call, answer me quickly.<br />The nations shall revere your name, O LORD, <br />and all the kings of the earth your glory,<br />when the LORD has rebuilt Zion <br />and appeared in his glory;<br />when he has regarded the prayer of the destitute, <br />and not despised their prayer.<br />Let this be written for the generation to come, <br />and let his future creatures praise the LORD:<br />\"The LORD looked down from his holy height, <br />from heaven he beheld the earth,<br />to hear the groaning of the prisoners, <br />to release those doomed to die.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>8,21-30.</em><p>Jesus said to the Pharisees: \"I am going away and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. Where I am going you cannot come.\"<br />So the Jews said, \"He is not going to kill himself, is he, because he said, 'Where I am going you cannot come'?\"<br />He said to them, \"You belong to what is below, I belong to what is above. You belong to this world, but I do not belong to this world.<br />That is why I told you that you will die in your sins. For if you do not believe that I AM, you will die in your sins.\"<br />So they said to him, \"Who are you?\" Jesus said to them, \"What I told you from the beginning.<br />I have much to say about you in condemnation. But the one who sent me is true, and what I heard from him I tell the world.\"<br />They did not realize that he was speaking to them of the Father.<br />So Jesus said (to them), \"When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will realize that I AM, and that I do nothing on my own, but I say only what the Father taught me.<br />The one who sent me is with me.

As the second son, he was crowned king of Orleans and Burgundy in 561 A.D. He made Chalons his capital. Meanwhile, his brothers, Charibert and Sigebert, reigned at Paris and Ostrasia. When compelled to take up arms against his ambitious brothers and the Lombards, King Gontran was victorious with the help of a brave general, Mommol. Together, they brought peace to the realm. The ensuing prosperity affirmed that civil law, derived from moral law, finds its basis and fulfillment in the Gospel. King Gontran treated the pastors of the Church with respect and veneration. He protected the oppressed with the worth and justice of a king. He prayed, fasted and offered himself to God day and night. King Gontran punished crimes committed by his officers and implemented regulations to restrain the sometimes barbarous conduct of his troops. In the face of adversity and moral pain, he was more ready to forgive offences against his own person than anyone. King Gontran built and endowed many churches and monasteries. He passed away at sixty-eighth, in 592 A.D., after reigning for thirty-one years and some months.</p>"

Jonas and Barachisius, two brothers from Beth-Asa, went to Hubaham to encourage and console the Christians on death row. It is recorded that they spoke with at least nine Christian martyrs. After the executions, Jonas and Barachisius were arrested. Local authorities entreated them to obey the Persian king and worship the sun, moon, fire and water. However, the brothers answered that it was more reasonable to obey the immortal King of heaven and earth than a mortal prince. For declining to worship spirits who are not God, Jonas was beaten with knotty clubs and rods and set in a freezing pond with a cord tied to his foot. Barachisius had two red-hot iron plates and two red-hot hammers pressed under each arm, and molten lead dropped into his nostrils and eyes. Afterward, he was carried to prison and hung by one foot. Despite the torture, the brothers remained steadfast. New and more horrible torments were devised to break their will, but the brothers expired without renouncing their faith. Sts.
