Anyone who wished to consult the LORD would go to this meeting tent outside the camp.<br />Whenever Moses went out to the tent, the people would all rise and stand at the entrance of their own tents, watching Moses until he entered the tent.<br />As Moses entered the tent, the column of cloud would come down and stand at its entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses.<br />On seeing the column of cloud stand at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and worship at the entrance of their own tents.<br />The LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, as one man speaks to another. Moses would then return to the camp, but his young assistant, Joshua, son of Nun, would not move out of the tent.<br />Moses stood there with the LORD and proclaimed his name, “LORD.”<br />Thus the LORD passed before him and cried out, \"The LORD, the LORD, a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger and rich in kindness and fidelity,<br />continuing his kindness for a thousand generations, and forgiving wickedness and crime and sin; yet not declaring the guilty guiltless, but punishing children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generation for their fathers' wickedness!\"<br />Moses at once bowed down to the ground in worship.<br />Then he said, \"If I find favor with you, O Lord, do come along in our company. This is indeed a stiff-necked people; yet pardon our wickedness and sins, and receive us as your own.\"<br />So Moses stayed there with the LORD for forty days and forty nights, without eating any food or drinking any water, and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>103(102),6-7.8-9.10-11.12-13.</em><p>The LORD secures justice <br />and the rights of all the oppressed.<br />He has made known his ways to Moses, <br />and his deeds to the children of Israel.<br />Merciful and gracious is the LORD, <br />slow to anger and abounding in kindness.<br />He will not always chide, <br />nor does he keep his wrath forever.<br />Not according to our sins does he deal with us, <br />nor does he requite us according to our crimes.<br />For as the heavens are high above the earth, <br />so surpassing is his kindness toward those who fear him.<br />As far as the east is from the west, <br />so far has he put our transgressions from us.<br />As a father has compassion on his children, <br />so the LORD has compassion on those who fear him.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>13,36-43.</em><p>Jesus dismissed the crowds and went into the house. His disciples approached him and said, \"Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.\"<br />He said in reply, \"He who sows good seed is the Son of Man,<br />the field is the world, the good seed the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the children of the evil one,<br />and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the harvesters are angels.<br />Just as weeds are collected and burned (up) with fire, so will it be at the end of the age.<br />The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will collect out of his kingdom all who cause others to sin and all evildoers.<br />They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.<br />Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears ought to hear.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Alphonsus Liguori((1696-1787))</h3><p>SAINT ALPHONSUS MARY DE LIGUORI Bishop and Doctor of the Church (1696-1787) St. Alphonsus was born to a patrician family near Naples in 1696. His spiritual formation was entrusted to the Fathers of the Oratory; and from his boyhood, Alphonsus was known as a most devout Brother of the Little Oratory. At the age of 16, he was awarded a doctorate in law; and he threw himself into this career with ardor and success. After losing an important case, Alphonsus saw the vanity of human fame and determined to labor only for the glory of God. He entered the priesthood, devoted himself to neglected souls,and founded later the missionary Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer to carry on the work. At the age of 66, Fr. Alphonsus was consecrated Bishop of St. Agatha and zealously undertook the reform of his diocese. He made a vow to never spend time idly; and though his life was spent in prayer and work, authored a vast number of spiritual and scientific books. He was declared a Doctor of the Church in 1871. St. Alphonsus wrote his first book at the age of 49, and had published about sixty volumes by 83 when his director forbade him to write more. Many of these books were written in the half-hours spent as a missionary, religious superior and bishop; or in the midst of physical and mental suffering. With his left hand he would hold a piece of marble against his aching head while his right hand wrote. St. Alphonsus counted no time wasted that was spent in charity. He did not refuse to hold a long correspondence with a simple soldier who asked his advice, or to play the harpsichord while he taught his novices to sing spiritual canticles. For his last seven years, St. Alphonsus was prevented by constant sickness from offering the Eucharist, but he received Holy Communion daily. St. Alphonsus loved Jesus and Mama Mary during his earthly pilgrimage; and opened his eyes to them forever in eternity.</p>"

She became Paul's first convert at Philippi. She was baptized with her household, and Paul rested at her home there. St. Lydia received St. Paul with joy and generosity. In a sense, we are indebted to her for the growth of the Church and salvation of souls. Her life can be summarized in the Lord's explanation of caritas and love for mankind: \"Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me\" (Mt. 25:40).</p><hr /><h3>Venerable Anthony Margil()</h3><hr />"

His parents dedicated him to our blessed Lady; and from childhood, he was nicknamed \"the saint.\" A distinguished student, Cajetan left Vicenza for Rome; and became the consul at the office of Pope Julius II. When a new pope was consecrated, he returned to Vicenza. He suffered the rancor of his relatives for joining the Confraternity of St. Jerome, whose members were drawn from underpriviledged communities. Now an adult, Cajetan spent his wealth building hospitals and nursing victims of the plague. To renew the lives of the clergy, Cajetan instituted the first community of Regular Clerks, known as Theatines. They devoted themselves to preaching, administration of the sacraments and carefully performing the Church's rites and ceremonies. Cajetan was the first to introduce the Forty Hours' Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament as an antidote to Calvin's heresy. He was lovingly devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary. In reciprocal love, she placed the infant Jesus in his arms on one Christmas Eve. His mystical experiences and visions were in no way tied to his sufferings, which are more pleasing to God when endured with faith, hope and love. When Germanic clans under the Constable Bourbon sacked Rome, they scourged Cajetan for the riches he had long since given away. Loyal and pure like Jesus, Cajetan endured his trials with manliness, courage and character. Alban Butler, translating Acta Sanctorum, gives this account of Fr. Cajetan's passing: \"When St. Cajetan was on his death-bed, resigned to the will of God, eager for pain to satisfy his love, and for death to attain to life, he beheld the Mother of God, radiant with splendor and surrounded by ministering seraphim. In profound veneration, he said, 'Lady, bless me!' Mary replied, 'Cajetan, receive the blessing of my Son, and know that I am here as a reward for the sincerity of your love, and to lead you to paradise.' She then exhorted him to patience in fighting an evil spirit who troubled him, and gave orders to the choirs of angels to escort his soul in triumph to heaven. Then, turning her countenance full of majesty and sweetness upon him, she said, 'Cajetan, my Son calls thee. Let us go in peace.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Sixtus II()</h3><hr />"

They do not wash (their) hands when they eat a meal.<br />He summoned the crowd and said to them, \"Hear and understand.<br />It is not what enters one's mouth that defiles that person; but what comes out of the mouth is what defiles one.\"<br />Then his disciples approached and said to him, \"Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?\"<br />He said in reply, \"Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.<br />Let them alone; they are blind guides (of the blind). If a blind person leads a blind person, both will fall into a pit.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Dominic(Priest (1170-1221))</h3><p>ST DOMINIC Priest (1170-1221) St. Dominic was born in Spain in 1170. As a student, he sold his books to feed the poor during a famine; and offered himself as ransom for a slave. At the age of 25, Dominic became superior of the Canons Regular of Osma, and accompanied his Bishop to France. There, his heart was well-nigh broken by the ravages of the Albigenian heresy, and his life was henceforth devoted to the conversion of heretics and the defence of the Faith. For this end, he established his threefold religious order. The convent for nuns was founded first to rescue young girls from heresy and crime. Afterward, a company of apostolic men gathered around him and became the Order of Friar Preachers. Lastly, an organization of laypersons was founded: the Tertiaries, persons of both sexes living in the world. God blessed the new order, and France, Italy, Spain and England welcomed the Preaching Friars. Our Lady took them under her special protection, and whispered to St. Dominic as he preached. It was in 1208, while St. Dominic knelt in the little chapel of Notre Dame de la Prouille, and implored the great Mother of God to save the Church, that Our Lady appeared to him, gave him the Rosary, and bade him go forth and preach. Beads in hand, St. Dominic converted herectics by the multitudes, with a victory that overcame heresy against overwhelming odds. His nights were spent in prayer; and though he was pure, he scourged himself thrice before daybreak, like one tensing his muscles to stave off temptations of the flesh. His words rescued countless souls; and three times he raised the dead to life. At length, on August 6, 1221, at the age of 51, Dominic gave up his soul to God; and was welcomed by Our Lady and Lord in Heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mary of the Cross Mackillop(Virgin)</h3><hr /><p>Mary of the Cross MacKillop was born on January 15, 1842, in Melbourne, Australia. Conditions in the mid-nineteenth century were still primitive. Poverty was rife, especially in country areas. Religious discrimination was also widespread, and the plight of native, aboriginal people was deplorable. Many of the first settlers were convicts with little education, and many were descendants of Irish Catholics, discriminated against because of their religion and place of origin. The Church had few priests to serve its people who were scattered around rural areas and experiencing poverty. Mary was the first of eight children of Catholic Scottish immigrants, Alexander MacKillop and Flora MacDonald. They imbued their children with a great love for the Church and the supernatural virtues of faith, hope and charity. Their family was poor, and the father was often without work because he dabbled in business and politics. Mary, in her teens, was called upon to assist the family finances by finding employment. At a young age, Mary had increasingly felt the call to live as a religious sister, but she still had the obligation to care for her family. While working as a governess in Penola, she met Father Julian Tenison Woods, who was the parish priest of a large part of South East, South Australia. At that period of Australian history, schools, medical care and any form of social services were lacking, especially for the poor. The Catholic rural poor were especially disadvantaged. Mary’s dream of a free education for such children corresponded with the dream of Father Woods. He became her mentor and spiritual director and encouraged her vocation. Together, they developed a plan for a congregation of sisters who would work wherever there was a need, but especially in rural areas. They would live in small convents or in whatever style of dwelling that the local people had. It was a courageous plan. In January 1866, the plan was put into action. Mary and her two sisters began teaching in Penola, South Australia, in a stable refurbished by her brother. With the encouragement and mentoring of Father Woods, the Congregation of the Sisters of Saint Joseph of the Sacred Heart was born. On the advice of Father Woods, Mary moved to the main South Australian city of Adelaide. On August 15, 1867, Mary and her companions professed the three vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Mary took the name Sister Mary of the Cross. She was joined by other young women, who responded to needs in rural areas. Without payment, they provided elementary teaching in religion and secular subjects to poor children who otherwise had no hope of education. Soon afterward, Mary’s charitable heart opened to the destitute and elderly who were friendless and abandoned in a harsh society without any social welfare. By 1869, there were sixty sisters working in schools, orphanages and refuges for women. Father Woods and Sr Mary envisaged the sisters being governed centrally by one superior and being free to go wherever there was a need anywhere in the colonies. In a short time, the sisters could be found in the other colonies and in New Zealand. A complex set of circumstances led to the Bishop of Adelaide, who was once her friend and benefactor, excommunicating Mary in 1871 for supposed disobedience. Mary accepted the excommunication and the dismissal of many of her sisters with serenity and peace. The Bishop revoked the sentence before his death less than six months later. Mary returned to her work and the majority of the sisters who had been sent away returned to the Institute. Mary was advised to go to Rome to seek the help of Pope Pius IX. Establishing a central government was crucial to sending the sisters anywhere they were needed. While in Rome, Mary did not receive final approval for the institute (this came in 1888), but she did receive encouragement from many, and especially from her three meetings with Pope Pius IX. She returned to Australia with support for central government. Back in Australia, further problems arose, and Mary was ordered to leave Adelaide for Sydney. In 1885, she was deposed as Mother General. Mary accepted the changes: retaining respect for the bishops and priesthood and encouraging her sisters to do the same. It was not until 1899 that the sisters were free to elect her as their Mother General, an office she held until her death. Mary was untiring in her zeal for the poor. One of her favorite sayings was, “Never see a need without doing something about it.” Her devotion to the Sacred Heart, the Blessed Sacrament and Saint Joseph impelled her to love God and all persons. Her attention to the will of God enabled her to accept the joys as well as the difficulties that beset her so frequently. She wrote, “The will of God is to me a very dear book and I never tire of reading it.” Throughout her life, Mary suffered from ill health and was often confined to bed with severe and debilitating headaches. Instead of becoming fixated, she lifted her spirit outside of her self, becoming even purer and closer to God. While visiting New Zealand when she was 60, she suffered a stroke. Her right side was impaired, but she learned to write with her left hand and continued in the office of Superior General and even made several visitations to faraway convents. By 1905, her health deteriorated, and for the next years she suffered while keeping a cheerful, pleasant outlook on life: always speaking of God’s will. In 1909, her condition worsened, and she passed away peacefully on August 8, 1909.Her last days were ones of recollection for those who were gathered around her. Cardinal Moran said when he left her, “I have this day attended the death-bed of a saint... Her death will bring many blessings.” One thousand sisters in the Institute mourned her death. Mary’s remains were removed to the Memorial Chapel at the Motherhouse in North Sydney, NSW, Australia. Three popes, Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI have prayed at her tomb, as have thousands of pilgrims annually from all over the world. The lasting memory many sisters had of Mary was her kindness. It was not just the kindness reflected in all the works for which she had been responsible, nor the kindness of an isolated, aloof person, but the kindness which St. Paul describes in his first letter to the Corinthians: \"Love is patient and kind; it is never jealous; love is never boastful or conceited; it is never rude or selfish; it does not take offence and is not resentful. Love... delights in the truth; it is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, to endure whatever comes\" (1 Cor.13: 4-7). During his visit to Sydney for World Youth Day in July 2008, Pope Benedict XVI, speaking about Mary MacKillop said, “I know that her perseverance in the face of adversity, her plea for justice on behalf of those unfairly treated and her practical example of holiness have become a source of inspiration for all Australians.” Quoting St. Mary MacKillop, he said, “Believe in the whisperings of God to your heart. Believe in him. Believe in the power of the Spirit of love.\"</p>"

You shall send one man from each ancestral tribe, all of them princes.\"<br />After reconnoitering the land for forty days they returned,<br />met Moses and Aaron and the whole community of the Israelites in the desert of Paran at Kadesh, made a report to them all, and showed them the fruit of the country.<br />They told Moses: \"We went into the land to which you sent us. It does indeed flow with milk and honey, and here is its fruit.<br />However, the people who are living in the land are fierce, and the towns are fortified and very strong. Besides, we saw descendants of the Anakim there.<br />Amalekites live in the region of the Negeb; Hittites, Jebusites and Amorites dwell in the highlands, and Canaanites along the seacoast and the banks of the Jordan.\"<br />Caleb, however, to quiet the people toward Moses, said, \"We ought to go up and seize the land, for we can certainly do so.\"<br />But the men who had gone up with him said, \"We cannot attack these people; they are too strong for us.\"<br />So they spread discouraging reports among the Israelites about the land they had scouted, saying, \"The land that we explored is a country that consumes its inhabitants. And all the people we saw there are huge men,<br />veritable giants (the Anakim were a race of giants); we felt like mere grasshoppers, and so we must have seemed to them.\"<br />At this, the whole community broke out with loud cries, and even in the night the people wailed.<br />The LORD also said to Moses and Aaron:<br />\"How long will this wicked community grumble against me? I have heard the grumblings of the Israelites against me.<br />Tell them: By my life, says the LORD, I will do to you just what I have heard you say.<br />Here in the desert shall your dead bodies fall. Of all your men of twenty years or more, registered in the census, who grumbled against me,<br />Forty days you spent in scouting the land; forty years shall you suffer for your crimes: one year for each day. Thus you will realize what it means to oppose me.<br />I, the LORD, have sworn to do this to all this wicked community that conspired against me: here in the desert they shall die to the last man.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>106(105),6-7a.13-14.21-22.23.</em><p>We have sinned, we and our fathers; <br />we have committed crimes; we have done wrong.<br />Our fathers in Egypt <br />considered not your wonders.<br />But soon they forgot his works; <br />they waited not for his counsel.<br />They gave way to craving in the desert <br />and tempted God in the wilderness.<br />They forgot the God who had saved them, <br />who had done great deeds in Egypt,<br />Wondrous deeds in the land of Ham, <br />terrible things at the Red Sea.<br />Then he spoke of exterminating them, <br />but Moses, his chosen one, <br />withstood him in the breach <br />to turn back his destructive wrath.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>15,21-28.</em><p>At that time Jesus withdrew to the region of Tyre and Sidon.<br />And behold, a Canaanite woman of that district came and called out, \"Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is tormented by a demon.\"<br />But he did not say a word in answer to her. His disciples came and asked him, \"Send her away, for she keeps calling out after us.\"<br />He said in reply, \"I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.\"<br />But the woman came and did him homage, saying, \"Lord, help me.\"<br />He said in reply, \"It is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs.\"<br />She said, \"Please, Lord, for even the dogs eat the scraps that fall from the table of their masters.\"<br />Then Jesus said to her in reply, \"O woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.\" And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p><hr /><h3>St. Teresa Benedicta of the Cross (Edith Stein)((1891-1942))</h3><p>Teresa Benedict of the Cross Edith Stein Nun, Discalced Carmelite, martyrCo-patron of Europe (1891-1942) \"We bow down before the testimony of the life and death of Edith Stein, an outstanding daughter of Israel and at the same time a daughter of the Carmelite Order, Sister Teresa Benedicta of the Cross, a personality who united within her rich life a dramatic synthesis of our century. It was the synthesis of a history full of deep wounds that are still hurting ... and also the synthesis of the full truth about man. All this came together in a single heart that remained restless and unfulfilled until it finally found rest in God\" (Pope John Paul II during Edith Stein's beatification in Cologne on 1 May 1987).Who is she? Edith Stein was born in Breslau on the 12th of October 1891, the youngest of 11, as her family were celebrating Yom Kippur, that most important Jewish feast, the Feast of Atonement. \"More than anything else, this helped make the youngest child very precious to her mother.\" Being born on this day was like a foreshadowing to Edith, a future Carmelite nun. Edith's father, who ran a timber business, died when she had only just turned two. Her mother, a very devout, hard-working, strong-willed and truly wonderful woman, now had to fend for herself and to look after the family and their large business. However, she did not succeed in keeping up a living faith in her children. Edith lost her faith in God. \"I consciously decided, of my own volition, to give up praying,\" she said. In 1911, she passed her school-leaving exam with flying colours and enrolled at the University of Breslau to study German and history, though this was a mere \"bread-and-butter\" choice. Her real interest was in philosophy and in women's issues. She became a member of the Prussian Society for Women's Franchise. \"When I was at school and during my first years at university,\" she wrote later, \"I was a radical suffragette. Then I lost interest in the whole issue. Now I am looking for purely pragmatic solutions.\" In 1913, Edith Stein transferred to Göttingen University, to study under the mentorship of Edmund Husserl. She became his pupil and teaching assistant, and he later tutored her for a doctorate. At the time, anyone who was interested in philosophy was fascinated by Husserl's new view of reality, whereby the world as we perceive it does not merely exist in a Kantian way, in our subjective perception. His pupils saw his philosophy as a return to objects: \"back to things\". Husserl's phenomenology unwittingly led many of his pupils to the Christian faith. In Göttingen Edith Stein also met the philosopher Max Scheler, who directed her attention to Roman Catholicism. Nevertheless, she did not neglect her \"bread-and-butter\" studies and passed her degree with distinction in January 1915, though she did not follow it up with teacher training. \"I no longer have a life of my own,\" she wrote at the beginning of the First World War, having done a nursing course and gone to serve in an Austrian field hospital. This was a hard time for her, during which she looked after the sick in the typhus ward, worked in an operating theatre, and saw young people die. When the hospital was dissolved, in 1916, she followed Husserl as his assistant to the German city of Freiburg, where she passed her doctorate summa cum laude (with the utmost distinction) in 1917, after writing a thesis on \"The Problem of Empathy.\" During this period she went to Frankfurt Cathedral and saw a woman with a shopping basket going in to kneel for a brief prayer. \"This was something totally new to me. In the synagogues and Protestant churches I had visited, people simply went to the services. Here, however, I saw someone coming straight from the busy marketplace into this empty church, as if she was going to have an intimate conversation. It was something I never forgot.\" Towards the end of her dissertation she wrote: \"There have been people who believed that a sudden change had occurred within them and that this was a result of God's grace.\" How could she come to such a conclusion? Edith Stein had been good friends with Husserl's Göttingen assistant, Adolf Reinach, and his wife. When Reinach fell in Flanders in November 1917, Edith went to Göttingen to visit his widow. The Reinachs had converted to Protestantism. Edith felt uneasy about meeting the young widow at first, but was surprised when she actually met with a woman of faith. \"This was my first encounter with the Cross and the divine power it imparts to those who bear it ... it was the moment when my unbelief collapsed and Christ began to shine his light on me - Christ in the mystery of the Cross.\" Later, she wrote: \"Things were in God's plan which I had not planned at all. I am coming to the living faith and conviction that - from God's point of view - there is no chance and that the whole of my life, down to every detail, has been mapped out in God's divine providence and makes complete and perfect sense in God's all-seeing eyes.\" In Autumn 1918, Edith Stein gave up her job as Husserl's teaching assistant. She wanted to work independently. It was not until 1930 that she saw Husserl again after her conversion, and she shared with him about her faith, as she would have liked him to become a Christian, too. Then she wrote down the amazing words: \"Every time I feel my powerlessness and inability to influence people directly, I become more keenly aware of the necessity of my own holocaust.\" Edith Stein wanted to obtain a professorship, a goal that was impossible for a woman at the time. Husserl wrote the following reference: \"Should academic careers be opened up to ladies, then I can recommend her whole-heartedly and as my first choice for admission to a professorship.\" Later, she was refused a professorship on account of her Jewishness. Back in Breslau, Edith Stein began to write articles about the philosophical foundation of psychology. However, she also read the New Testament, Kierkegaard and Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises. She felt that one could not just read a book like that, but had to put it into practice.In the summer of 1921, she spent several weeks in Bergzabern (in the Palatinate) on the country estate of Hedwig Conrad-Martius, another pupil of Husserl's. Hedwig had converted to Protestantism with her husband. One evening Edith picked up an autobiography of St. Teresa of Avila and read this book all night. \"When I had finished the book, I said to myself: This is the truth.\" Later, looking back on her life, she wrote: \"My longing for truth was a single prayer.\" On the 1st of January 1922, Edith Stein was baptized. It was the Feast of the Circumcision of Jesus, when Jesus entered into the covenant of Abraham. Edith Stein stood by the baptismal font, wearing Hedwig Conrad-Martius' white wedding cloak. Hedwig was her godmother. \"I had given up practising my Jewish religion when I was a 14-year-old girl and did not begin to feel Jewish again until I had returned to God.\" From this moment on she was continually aware that she belonged to Christ not only spiritually, but also through her blood. At the Feast of the Purification of Mary - another day with an Old Testament reference - she was confirmed by the Bishop of Speyer in his private chapel. After her conversion she went straight to Breslau: \"Mother,\" she said, \"I am a Catholic.\" The two women cried. Hedwig Conrad Martius wrote: \"Behold, two Israelites indeed, in whom is no deceit!\" (cf. John 1:47). Immediately after her conversion, she wanted to join a Carmelite convent. However, her spiritual mentors, Vicar-General Schwind of Speyer, and Erich Przywara SJ, stopped her from doing so. Until Easter 1931, she held a position teaching German and History at the Dominican Sisters' school and teacher training college of St. Magdalen's Convent in Speyer. At the same time, she was encouraged by Arch-Abbot Raphael Walzer of Beuron Abbey to accept extensive speaking engagements, mainly on women's issues. \"During the time immediately before and quite some time after my conversion I ... thought that leading a religious life meant giving up all earthly things and having one's mind fixed on divine things only. Gradually, however, I learnt that other things are expected of us in this world... I even believe that the deeper someone is drawn to God, the more he has to `get beyond himself' in this sense, that is, go into the world and carry divine life into it.\" She worked enormously hard, translating the letters and diaries of Cardinal Newman from his pre-Catholic period as well as Thomas Aquinas' Quaestiones Disputatae de Veritate. The latter was a very free translation, for the sake of dialogue with modern philosophy. Erich Przywara also encouraged her to write her own philosophical works. She learnt that it was possible to \"pursue scholarship as a service to God... It was not until I had understood this that I seriously began to approach academic work again.\" To gain strength for her life and work, she frequently went to the Benedictine Monastery of Beuron, to celebrate the great feasts of the Church year. In 1931, Edith Stein left the convent school in Speyer and devoted herself to working for a professorship again, this time in Breslau and Freiburg, though her endeavours were in vain. It was then that she wrote Potency and Act, a study of the central concepts developed by Thomas Aquinas. Later, at the Carmelite Convent in Cologne, she rewrote this study to produce her main philosophical and theological oeuvre, Finite and Eternal Being. By then, however, it was no longer possible to print the book. In 1932, she accepted a lectureship position at the Roman Catholic division of the German Institute for Educational Studies at the University of Munster, where she developed her anthropology. She successfully combined scholarship and faith in her work and her teaching, seeking to be a \"tool of the Lord\" in everything she taught. \"If anyone comes to me, I want to lead them to Him.\" In 1933,darkness broke out over Germany. \"I had heard of severe measures against Jews before. But now it dawned on me that God had laid his hand heavily on His people, and that the destiny of these people would also be mine.\" The Aryan Law of the Nazis made it impossible for Edith Stein to continue teaching. \"If I can't go on here, then there are no longer any opportunities for me in Germany,\" she wrote; \"I had become a stranger in the world.\" The Arch-Abbot of Beuron, Walzer, now no longer stopped her from entering a Carmelite convent. While in Speyer, she had already taken a vow of poverty, chastity and obedience. In 1933, she met with the prioress of the Carmelite Convent in Cologne. \"Human activities cannot help us, but only the suffering of Christ. It is my desire to share in it.\" Edith Stein went to Breslau for the last time to say good-bye to her mother and her family. Her last day at home was her birthday, 12 October, which was also the last day of the Feast of Tabernacles. Edith went to the synagogue with her mother. It was a hard day for the two women. \"Why did you get to know it [Christianity]?\" her mother asked, \"I don't want to say anything against him. He may have been a very good person. But why did he make himself God?\" Edith's mother cried. The following day Edith was on the train to Cologne. \"I did not feel any passionate joy. What I had just experienced was too terrible. But I felt a profound peace - in the safe haven of God's will.\" From now on she wrote to her mother every week, though she never received any replies. Instead, her sister Rosa sent her news from Breslau. Edith joined the Carmelite Convent of Cologne on the 14th of October, and her investiture took place on the 15th of April, 1934. The mass was celebrated by the Arch-Abbot of Beuron. Edith Stein was now known as Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce - Teresa, Blessed of the Cross. In 1938 she wrote: \"I understood the cross as the destiny of God's people, which was beginning to be apparent at the time (1933). I felt that those who understood the Cross of Christ should take it upon themselves on everybody's behalf. Of course, I know better now what it means to be wedded to the Lord in the sign of the cross. However, one can never comprehend it, because it is a mystery.\" On the 21st of April 1935, she took her temporary vows. On the 14th of September 1936, the renewal of her vows coincided with her mother's death in Breslau. \"My mother held on to her faith to the last moment. But as her faith and her firm trust in her God... were the last thing that was still alive in the throes of her death, I am confident that she will have met a very merciful judge and that she is now my most faithful helper, so that I can reach the goal as well.\" When she made her eternal profession on the 21st of April 1938, she had the words of St. John of the Cross printed on her devotional picture: \"Henceforth my only vocation is to love.\" Her final work was to be devoted to this author. Edith Stein's entry into the Carmelite Order was not escapism. \"Those who join the Carmelite Order are not lost to their near and dear ones, but have been won for them, because it is our vocation to intercede to God for everyone.\" In particular, she interceded to God for her people: \"I keep thinking of Queen Esther who was taken away from her people precisely because God wanted her to plead with the king on behalf of her nation. I am a very poor and powerless little Esther, but the King who has chosen me is infinitely great and merciful. This is great comfort\" (31st of October 1938). On the 9th of November 1938, the anti-Semitism of the Nazis became apparent to the whole world. Synagogues were burnt, and the Jewish people were subjected to terror. The prioress of the Carmelite Convent in Cologne did her utmost to take Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce abroad. On New Year's Eve 1938, she was smuggled across the border into the Netherlands, to the Carmelite Convent in Echt in the Province of Limburg. This is where she wrote her will on 9th of June 1939: \"Even now I accept the death that God has prepared for me in complete submission and with joy as being his most holy will for me. I ask the Lord to accept my life and my death ... so that the Lord will be accepted by His people and that His Kingdom may come in glory, for the salvation of Germany and the peace of the world.\" While in the Cologne convent, Edith Stein had been given permission to start her academic studies again. Among other things, she wrote about \"The Life of a Jewish Family\" (that is, her own family): \"I simply want to report what I experienced as part of Jewish humanity,\" she said, pointing out that \"we who grew up in Judaism have a duty to bear witness ... to the young generation who are brought up in racial hatred from early childhood.\" In Echt, Edith Stein hurriedly completed her study of \"The Church's Teacher of Mysticism and the Father of the Carmelites, John of the Cross, on the Occasion of the 400th Anniversary of His Birth, 1542-1942.\" In 1941, she wrote to a friend, who was also a member of her order: \"One can only gain a scientia crucis (knowledge of the cross) if one has thoroughly experienced the cross. I have been convinced of this from the first moment onwards and have said with all my heart: 'Ave, Crux, Spes unica' (I welcome you, Cross, our only hope).\" Her study on St. John of the Cross is entitled: \"Kreuzeswissenschaft\" (The Science of the Cross). Edith Stein was arrested by the Gestapo on the 2nd of August 1942 while she was in the chapel with the other sisters. She was to report within five minutes, together with her sister Rosa, who had also converted and was serving at the Echt Convent. Her last words to be heard in Echt were addressed to Rosa: \"Come, we are going for our people.\" Together with many other Jewish Christians, the two women were taken to a transit camp in Amersfoort and then to Westerbork. This was an act of retaliation against the letter of protest written by the Dutch Roman Catholic Bishops against the pogroms and deportations of Jews. Edith commented, \"I never knew that people could be like this, neither did I know that my brothers and sisters would have to suffer like this... I pray for them every hour. Will God hear my prayers? He will certainly hear them in their distress.\" Prof. Jan Nota, who was greatly attached to her, wrote later: \"She is a witness to God's presence in a world where God is absent.\" On the 7th of August, early in the morning, nine hundred eighty-seven Jews were deported to Auschwitz. It was probably on the 9th of August that Sister Teresia Benedicta a Cruce, her sister and many other of her people were gassed. When Edith Stein was beatified in Cologne on the 1st of May 1987, the Church honoured \"a daughter of Israel,\" as Pope John Paul II put it, \"who, as a Catholic during Nazi persecution, remained faithful to the crucified Lord Jesus Christ and, as a Jew, to her people in loving faithfulness.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Romanus()</h3><hr />"

In 258, he witnessed Pope Sixtus being led to martyrdom. The event surely impacted his outlook. \"I was your ministerwhen you consecrated the blood of our Lord; your sacrifices will never be in vain.\" The holy Pope comforted him with the words, \"Do not be afraid, my son.\" The prefect of the city knew the rich offerings that Christians put into the hands of the clergy, and he demanded the treasures of the Roman Church from Lawrence. The Saint promised, at the end of three days, to show him riches exceeding all the wealth of the empire; and set about collecting the poor, the infirm, and the religious who lived by the alms of the faithful. He then bade the prefect \"see the treasures of the Church\". Christ, whom Lawrence had served in the poor, gave him strength in the conflict which ensued. Roasted over a slow fire, he made sport of his pains. \"I am done enough,\" he said, \"eat, if you will.\" At length Christ, the Father of the poor, received him into Paradise. God's glory shone about St. Lawrence, illuminating the value set upon His love for the poor. Innumerable prayers were granted at St. Lawrence's tomb; and he continues his charity towards us from heaven. As St. Augustine says, Lawrence granted \"the smaller graces which they sought, and leading them to the desire of better gifts.\"</p>"

Was it ever heard of?<br />Did a people ever hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of fire, as you did, and live?<br />Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by testings, by signs and wonders, by war, with his strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors, all of which the LORD, your God, did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?<br />All this you were allowed to see that you might know the LORD is God and there is no other.<br />Out of the heavens he let you hear his voice to discipline you; on earth he let you see his great fire, and you heard him speaking out of the fire.<br />For love of your fathers he chose their descendants and personally led you out of Egypt by his great power,<br />driving out of your way nations greater and mightier than you, so as to bring you in and to make their land your heritage, as it is today.<br />This is why you must now know, and fix in your heart, that the LORD is God in the heavens above and on earth below, and that there is no other.<br />You must keep his statutes and commandments which I enjoin on you today, that you and your children after you may prosper, and that you may have long life on the land which the LORD, your God, is giving you forever.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>77(76),12-13.14-15.16.21.</em><p>I remember the deeds of the LORD; <br />yes, I remember your wonders of old.  <br />And I meditate on your works; <br />your exploits I ponder.<br />O God, your way is holy; <br />what great god is there like our God?<br />You are the God who works wonders; <br />among the peoples you have made known your power.<br />With your strong arm you redeemed your people, <br />the sons of Jacob and Joseph.<br />You led your people like a flock <br />under the care of Moses and Aaron.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>16,24-28.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples, “Whoever wishes to come after me must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.<br />For whoever wishes to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.<br />What profit would there be for one to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?

This maiden was St. Clare. Already she had learnt from St. Francis to hate the world's vanities, and was secretly resolved to live for God alone. She had escaped with one companion to the Church of the Portiuncula, where she was met by St. Francis and his brethren. At the altar of Our Lady, St. Francis cut off her hair, clothed her in his habit of penance, a piece of sack-cloth, with his cord as a girdle. Thus she was espoused to Christ. In a rustic house outside Assisi, she founded her Order, and was joined by her sister, fourteen years of age, and afterwards by her mother and other noble ladies. They went barefoot, observed perpetual abstinence, constant silence, and perfect poverty. While the Saracen army of Frederick II was ravaging the valley of Spoleto, a body of marauders advanced to assault St. Clare's convent outside Assisi. The Saint caused the Blessed Sacrament to be placed in a monstrance, above the gate of the monastery facing the enemy, and kneeling before it, prayed, \"Deliver us, O Lord, the souls of those who confess to Thee.\" A voice from the Host replied, \"My protection will never fail you.\" A sudden panic seized the attacking mercenaries, who took to flight, and the Saint's convent was spared. St. Clare was born to eternal life in 1253 while the Passion was being read, and the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to those present.</p><hr /><h3>St. Philomena()</h3><hr />"

Nothing will be impossible for you.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Jane Frances de Chantal (1572-1641)()</h3><p>SAINT JANE FRANCES DE CHANTAL(1572-1641) At the age of sixteen, Jane Frances de Frémyot, already an orphan, was placed under the care of a worldly-minded governess. In this crisis, she offered herself to the Mother of God and secured Mary's protection for life. When a Protestant sought her hand, she refused to marry one who lacked character and morals,and shortly afterward married Baron de Chantal, who gave her the home and heart of a fully Christian man. But God had marked her for something higher than domestic sanctity. Two children and a dearly beloved sister died, and, in the full tide of prosperity, her husband's life was taken by the innocent hand of a friend. For seven years, the sorrows of her widowhood were increased by ill-usage from servants and the importunities of friends who urged her to marry again. Harassed almost to despair, she branded Jesus' name over her heart and left her home and children to live for God alone. On March 19, 1609, Madame de Chantal bade farewell to her family and relations. With tenderness and affection, she passed around the large room, sweetly and humbly taking leave of each. Her son, a boy of fifteen, used every entreaty and endearment to induce his mother not to leave; and at last flung himself across the door of the room. In an agony of distress, she passed over her son to the embrace of her aged and disconsolate father. The anguish of that parting reached its height when she obtained his last blessing, promising to repay his sacrifices by her prayers. Well might St. Francis call her \"the valiant woman.\" She was to found, with St. Francis de Sales, a great Order. Sickness, opposition and want beset her, and the death of children, friends, and of St. Francis himself followed, while eighty-seven houses of the Visitation rose. Nine long years of interior desolation completed the work of God's grace; and in her seventieth year, St. Vincent of Paul saw, at the moment of her death, her soul called to heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Euplius()</h3><hr />"

When a war ensued, our Saint, at the age of twelve, was made prisoner and carried captive by Clotaire, King of Soissons, who had her instructed in the Christian faith and baptized. The great mysteries of Faith made such an impression on her tender soul that she gave herself to God with her whole heart, and desired to consecrate to him her virginity. She was obliged at last, however, to yield to the king's wish that she should become his wife. As a great queen, she continued no less an enemy to sloth and vanity than she was before, and divided her time chiefly between her oratory, the Church, and the care of the poor. She also kept long fasts, and during Lent wore a hair-cloth under her rich garments. King Clotaire was at first pleased with her devotions, and allowed her full liberty in them, but later reproached her for her pious exercises, saying he had married a nun rather than a queen, who converted his court into a monastery. Seeing that Clotaire was inflamed by bad passions, our Saint asked and obtained his leave to retire from court. She went to Noyon, and was consecrated deaconess by St. Medard. St. Radegundes first withdrew to Sais, and some time after she went to Poitiers, and there built a great monastery. She had a holy virgin, named Agnes, made the first abbess, and paid to her an implicit obedience in all things, not reserving to herself the disposal of the least thing. King Clotaire, repenting of his evil conduct, wished her to return to court, but, through the intercession of St. Germanus of Paris, she was allowed to remain in her retirement, where she passed away on the 13th of August, 587.</p><hr /><h3>St. John Berchmans()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Sts.

The Kolbe home was poor but full of love. His parents, hardworking and religious, educated their three sons with rectitude. Around 1906, an event took place that marked a fundamental milestone in his life. His mother related the event a few months after her son's martyrdom. \"I knew ahead of time, based on an extraordinary event that took place in his infancy, that Maximilian would die a martyr. I just don't recall if it took place before or after his first confession. Once I did not like one of his pranks and I reproached him for it: 'My son, what ever will become of you?!' Later, I did not think of it again, but I noticed that the boy had changed so radically, he was hardly recognizable. We had a small altar hidden between two dressers before which he used to often retire without being noticed and he would pray there crying. In general, he had a conduct superior to his age, always recollected and serious and when he prayed he would burst into tears. I was worried, thinking he had some sort of illness so I asked him: 'Is there anything wrong? You should share everything with your mommy!' Trembling with emotion and with his eyes flooded in tears, he shared: 'Mama, when you reproached me, I pleaded with the Blessed Mother to tell me what would become of me. At Church I did the same; I prayed the same thing again. So then the Blessed Mother appeared to me holding in her hands two crowns: one white the other red. She looked at me with tenderness and asked me if I wanted these two crowns. The white one signified that I would preserve my purity and the red that I would be a martyr. I answered that I accepted them...(both of them). Then the Virgin Mary looked at me with sweetness and disappeared.' The extraordinary change in the boys' behavior testified to me the truth of what he related. He was fully conscious and as he spoke to me, with his face radiating; it showed me his desire to die a martyr.\" When he was 13, he entered the Franciscan Fathers Seminary in the Polish city of Lvov, which was then occupied by Austria. It was in the seminary where he adopted the name Maximilian. He completed his studies in Rome. Before his ordination as a priest in 1918, Maximilian founded the Immaculata Movement devoted to our Lady. He spread the movement through a magazine entitled \"The Knight of the Immaculata.\" \"We should conquer the universe and each soul, now and in the future until the end of time, for the Immaculata and through her for the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\" (St. Maximilian Maria Kolbe, The Knight of the Immaculata) Maximilian went to Japan and then on to India where he furthered the Movement. After a few years in Japan, he was summoned back to Poland, largely due to his ever-declining health. Three years later, in the midst of the Second World War, he was imprisoned along with other friars and sent to concentration camps in Germany and Poland. In February of 1941, he was again imprisoned and sent to the concentration camp in Auschwitz, where in spite of the terrible living conditions, he continued his ministry. On July 31, 1941, in reprisal for one prisoner's escape, ten men were chosen to die. Father Kolbe offered himself in place of a young husband and father. He was the last to die after two weeks of starvation, thirst and neglect. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1982 as a Martyr of Charity.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Eberhard()</h3><hr />"

I have let you feast your eyes upon it, but you shall not cross over.\"<br />So there, in the land of Moab, Moses, the servant of the LORD, died as the LORD had said;<br />and he was buried in the ravine opposite Beth-peor in the land of Moab, but to this day no one knows the place of his burial.<br />Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died, yet his eyes were undimmed and his vigor unabated.<br />For thirty days the Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab, till they had completed the period of grief and mourning for Moses.<br />Now Joshua, son of Nun, was filled with the spirit of wisdom, since Moses had laid his hands upon him; and so the Israelites gave him their obedience, thus carrying out the LORD'S command to Moses.<br />Since then no prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.<br />He had no equal in all the signs and wonders the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh and all his servants and against all his land,<br />and for the might and the terrifying power that Moses exhibited in the sight of all Israel.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>66(65),1-3a.5.8.16-17.</em><p>Shout joyfully to God, all the earth,<br />sing praise to the glory of his name; <br />proclaim his glorious praise.<br />Say to God, “How tremendous are your deeds!”<br />Come and see the works of God, <br />his tremendous deeds among the children of Adam.<br />Bless our God, you peoples; <br />loudly sound his praise,<br />Hear now, all you who fear God, while I declare <br />what he has done for me.<br />When I appealed to him in words, <br />praise was on the tip of my tongue.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>18,15-20.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.

In a vision, they saw St. Stephen the Martyr, who told them their son would perfect the work they had begun. Their son was born in 977 and named Stephen. Stephen was carefully educated and became Duke of Hungary at an early age. He rooted out idolatry, suppressed a rebellion by pagan nationalists, and founded monasteries and churches. He asked Pope Sylvester to appoint bishops to the eleven sees he had endowed. The Pope granted Stephen's requests; and crowned Stephen King of Hungary. King Stephen placed his kingdom under the protection of our blessed Lady, gave and enforced good laws and served his people as he served Jesus. His only wars were wars of defence, and he was always successful. God sent him many and sore trials. One by one his children died, but he bore everything with perfect reliance upon the will of God. Before King Stephen died, he urged Hungary's bishops and nobles to nurture and cherish the Catholic Church, which was still as a tender plant in Hungary. He passed away during thefeast day of the Assumption of Mary: Attaining the beatific vision and beholding God face to face forever.</p>"

Thus the people crossed over opposite Jericho.<br />While all Israel crossed over on dry ground, the priests carrying the ark of the covenant of the LORD remained motionless on dry ground in the bed of the Jordan until the whole nation had completed the passage.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>114(113A),1-2.3-4.5-6.</em><p>When Israel came forth from Egypt,<br /> the house of Jacob from an alien people,<br />Judah became God's holy place, <br />Israel, God's domain.<br />The sea beheld and fled;<br />the Jordan turned back.<br />The mountains skipped like rams; <br />the hills, like lambs of the flock.<br />Why was it, sea, that you fled? <br />O Jordan, that you turned back?<br />You mountains, that you skipped like rams? <br />You hills, like lambs of the flock?</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>18,21-35.19,1.</em><p>Peter approached Jesus and asked him, \"Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive him? As many as seven times?\"<br />Jesus answered, \"I say to you, not seven times but seventy-seven times.<br />That is why the kingdom of heaven may be likened to a king who decided to settle accounts with his servants.<br />When he began the accounting, a debtor was brought before him who owed him a huge amount.<br />Since he had no way of paying it back, his master ordered him to be sold, along with his wife, his children, and all his property, in payment of the debt.<br />At that, the servant fell down, did him homage, and said, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back in full.'<br />Moved with compassion the master of that servant let him go and forgave him the loan.<br />When that servant had left, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a much smaller amount. He seized him and started to choke him, demanding, 'Pay back what you owe.'<br />Falling to his knees, his fellow servant begged him, 'Be patient with me, and I will pay you back.'<br />But he refused. Instead, he had him put in prison until he paid back the debt.<br />Now when his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were deeply disturbed, and went to their master and reported the whole affair.<br />His master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you your entire debt because you begged me to.<br />Should you not have had pity on your fellow servant, as I had pity on you?'<br />Then in anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he should pay back the whole debt.<br />So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.\"<br />When Jesus finished these words, he left Galilee and went to the district of Judea across the Jordan.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hyacinth(Dominican Missionary (1185-1257))</h3><p>SAINT HYACINTHDominican Missionary(1185-1257) St. Hyacinth was an apostle to Poland and Russia. He was born in 1185 to a Polish patrician family. After experiencing a calling, and following careful discernment, he decided to serve God as a religious. In 1218, as Canon of Cracow, Hyacinth accompanied his uncle, the bishop of Cracow, to Rome. There, Hyacinth met St. Dominic and received the habit of the Friar Preachers. Henceforth, Hyacinth's progress in virtue was so remarkable that St. Dominic sent him topreach and establish the Order in Poland. In a short time, Hyacinth founded two houses. Hyacinth's apostolic journeys were far and wide. He evangelized in Austria, Bohemia, Livonia, on the shores of the Black Sea, Tartary and Northern China. To the West, he evangelized in Sweden, Norway and Scotland. Churches and convents were built thanks to his work; and miracles were attributed to his intercession. Hyacinth inherited St. Dominic's filial confidence in the Mother of God. She guided his vocation and secured his final perseverance. When Hyacinth was at Kiev and the Tartars attacked, he rescued the ciborium and a Statue of Mary from being looted, but only after finishing the Mass. The statue was made of heavy alabaster, but when Hyacinth took in it in his arms, it became light as a reed. He carried it to the other side of the riverDnieper together with the Eucharist, as if he walked on water. On the eve of the Assumption, Hyacinth was told by an angel of his impending death. Despite extreme physical weakness, he celebrated Mass the next day. Shortly afterward, he was annointed, and passed away in the presence of God at the foot of the altar.</p>"

When they stood in ranks before God,<br />Joshua addressed all the people: \"Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: In times past your fathers, down to Terah, father of Abraham and Nahor, dwelt beyond the River and served other gods.<br />But I brought your father Abraham from the region beyond the River and led him through the entire land of Canaan. I made his descendants numerous, and gave him Isaac.<br />To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I assigned the mountain region of Seir in which to settle, while Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.<br />\"Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and smote Egypt with the prodigies which I wrought in her midst.<br />Afterward I led you out of Egypt, and when you reached the sea, the Egyptians pursued your fathers to the Red Sea with chariots and horsemen.<br />Because they cried out to the LORD, he put darkness between your people and the Egyptians, upon whom he brought the sea so that it engulfed them. After you witnessed what I did to Egypt, and dwelt a long time in the desert,<br />I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived east of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I delivered them into your power. You took possession of their land, and I destroyed them (the two kings of the Amorites) before you.<br />Then Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, prepared to war against Israel. He summoned Balaam, son of Beor, to curse you;<br />but I would not listen to Balaam. On the contrary, he had to bless you, and I saved you from him.<br />Once you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho, the men of Jericho fought against you, but I delivered them also into your power.<br />And I sent the hornets ahead of you which drove them (the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites and Jebusites) out of your way; it was not your sword or your bow.<br />\"I gave you a land which you had not tilled and cities which you had not built, to dwell in; you have eaten of vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>136(135),1-3.16-18.21-22.24.</em><p>Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />Give thanks to the God of gods, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />Give thanks to the LORD of lords, <br />for his mercy endures forever.<br />Who led his people through the wilderness, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />Who smote great kings, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />And slew powerful kings, <br />for his mercy endures forever.<br />And made their land a heritage, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />The heritage of Israel his servant, <br />for his mercy endures forever;<br />And freed us from our foes, <br />for his mercy endures forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>19,3-12.</em><p>Some Pharisees approached Jesus, and tested him, saying, \"Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause whatever?\"<br />He said in reply, \"Have you not read that from the beginning the Creator 'made them male and female'<br />and said, 'For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh'?<br />So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, no human being must separate.\"<br />They said to him, \"Then why did Moses command that the man give the woman a bill of divorce and dismiss (her)?\"<br />He said to them, \"Because of the hardness of your hearts Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.<br />I say to you, whoever divorces his wife (unless the marriage is unlawful) and marries another commits adultery.\"<br />(His) disciples said to him, \"If that is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry.\"<br />He answered, \"Not all can accept (this) word, but only those to whom that is granted.<br />Some are incapable of marriage because they were born so; some, because they were made so by others; some, because they have renounced marriage for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Whoever can accept this ought to accept it.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga(Priest (1901-1952))</h3><p>Saint Alberto Hurtado CruchagaPriest(1901-1952) Alberto Hurtado Cruchaga was born in Viña del Mar, Chile, on the 22nd of January 1901. He was orphaned at 4 by the death of his father. His mother had to sell their modest property at a loss to pay the family's debts. As a further consequence, Alberto and his brother had to live with relatives, and were often moved from one family to another. From an early age, Alberto experienced what it meant to be poor, without a home and at the mercy of others. After completing his secondary education, Alberto was given a scholarship to the Jesuit College in Santiago. There, he became a member of the Sodality of Our Lady and developed a lively interest in the poor: spending time with them in the slums every Sunday afternoon. When he completed his secondary education in 1917, Alberto wanted to become a Jesuit, but he postponed his novitiate to take care of his mother and younger brother. By working in the afternoons and evenings, he successfully supported them. At the same time, he studied law at the Catholic University. During this period, he maintained his care for the poor and continued to visit them every Sunday. Obligatory military service interrupted his studies, but once he fulfilled this duty, he went on to earn his degree in August 1923. On the 14th of August 1923, Alberto entered the Novitiate of the Society of Jesus in Chillán. In 1925, he went to Córdoba, Argentina, where he studied humanities. In 1927, he was sent to Spain to study philosophy and theology. However, because of the suppression of the Jesuits in Spain in 1931, he went on to Belgium and continued studying theology at Louvain. He was ordained a priest there on the 24th of August 1933, and in 1935 obtained a doctorate in pedagogy and psychology. After completing his Tertianship in Drongen, Belgium, Fr. Alberto returned to Chile in January 1936. He began working as a professor of religion at Colegio San Ignacio, and of Pedagogy at the Catholic University of Santiago. He was entrusted with the Sodality of Our Lady for the students, and he involved them in teaching catechism to the poor. He frequently directed retreats and offered spiritual direction to many young men, accompanying several of them in their response to the priestly vocation and contributing in an outstanding manner to the formation of many Christian laymen. In 1941, Fr. Alberto published his most famous book: \"Is Chile a Catholic Country?\" The same year, he was asked to assume the role of Assistant for the Youth Movement of the Catholic Action, first within the Archdiocese of Santiago and then nationally. He performed these roles with an exceptional spirit of initiative, dedication and sacrifice. In October 1944, while giving a retreat, he felt impelled to appeal to his audience to consider the many poor people of the city, especially the numerous homeless children who were roaming the streets of Santiago. This request evoked a ready and generous response. This was the beginning of the initiative for which Fr. Alberto is especially well-known: a form of charitable activity which provided not only housing but a home-like milieu for the homeless: \"El Hogar de Cristo.\" By means of contributions from benefactors and with the active collaboration of committed laity, Fr. Alberto opened the first house for children. This was followed by a house for women and then one for men. The poor found a warm home in \"El Hogar de Cristo.\" The houses multiplied and took on new dimensions. In some houses, there were rehabilitation centers; in others, trade-schools and so on. In 1945, Fr. Alberto visited the United States to study the \"Boys Town\" movement and to consider how it could be adapted to his own country. The last six years of his life were dedicated to the development of various forms in which \"El Hogar\" could exist and function. In 1947, Fr. Alberto founded the Chilean Trade Union Association (ASICH) to promote a union movement inspired by the social teaching of the Church. Between 1947 and 1950, he wrote three important works: on trade unions, on social humanism, and on the Christian social order. In 1951, he founded \"Mensaje,\" the well-known Jesuit periodical dedicated to explaining the doctrine of the Church. Pancreatic cancer brought Fr. Alberto to the end of his life. In the midst of terrible pain, he was often heard saying, \"I am content, Lord.\" After spending his life manifesting Christ's love for the poor, Fr. Alberto was called to Paradise on the 18th of August 1952. From his return to Chile after his Tertianship to his death, a matter of only fifteen years, Fr. Alberto lived and accomplished all the works described above. His apostolate was the expression of a personal love for Christ the Lord; it was characterized by a great love for poor and abandoned children, an enlightened zeal for the formation of the laity, and a lively sense of Christian social justice. He was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on the 23rd of October 2005.</p>"

As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.\"<br />But the people answered, \"Far be it from us to forsake the LORD for the service of other gods.<br />For it was the LORD, our God, who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a state of slavery. He performed those great miracles before our very eyes and protected us along our entire journey and among all the peoples through whom we passed.<br />At our approach the LORD drove out (all the peoples, including) the Amorites who dwelt in the land. Therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God.\"<br />Joshua in turn said to the people, \"You may not be able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God who will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.<br />If, after the good he has done for you, you forsake the LORD and serve strange gods, he will do evil to you and destroy you.\"<br />But the people answered Joshua, \"We will still serve the LORD.\"<br />Joshua therefore said to the people, \"You are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the LORD.\" They replied, \"We are, indeed!\"<br />\"Now, therefore, put away the strange gods that are among you and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel.\"<br />Then the people promised Joshua, \"We will serve the LORD, our God, and obey his voice.\"<br />So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem,<br />which he recorded in the book of the law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was in the sanctuary of the LORD.<br />And Joshua said to all the people, \"This stone shall be our witness, for it has heard all the words which the LORD spoke to us. It shall be a witness against you, should you wish to deny your God.\"<br />Then Joshua dismissed the people, each to his own heritage.<br />After these events, Joshua, son of Nun, servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>16(15),1-2a.5.7-8.11.</em><p>Keep me, O God, for in you I take refuge;<br />I say to the LORD, \"My Lord are you.\"<br />O LORD, my allotted portion and my cup, <br />you it is who hold fast my lot.<br />I bless the LORD who counsels me; <br />even in the night my heart exhorts me.<br />I set the LORD ever before me; <br />with him at my right hand I shall not be disturbed.<br />You will show me the path to life, <br />fullness of joys in your presence, <br />the delights at your right hand forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>19,13-15.</em><p>Children were brought to Jesus that he might lay his hands on them and pray.

He grew up in a village commonly known as Ri in the diocese of Seez in France. He made a vow of perpetual chastity after his first Holy Communion. At school, where he was very proficient in his studies, he was conspicuous for his remarkable piety. He had the greatest love for the Blessed Virgin and burned with a marvelous love for his neighbor. John enrolled himself in the Congregation of the Oratory founded by Cardinal de Berullé. Later, he was ordained a priest at Paris. He was made rector of the Oratorian house at Caen, but later withdrew from the congregation to educate suitable parishioners for the ministry of the Church. Accordingly, with five associates, he founded a congregation of priests and gave it the most holy names of Jesus and Mary. He opened the first seminary at Caen, and it was followed afterward by many others. To reunite women of immoral life with Christ, he founded the Institute of Our Lady of Charity, of which the Congregation of the Good Shepherd of Angers is a branch. Among his other works of charity is the Society of the Admirable Heart of the Mother of God. Burning with singular love toward the Hearts of Jesus and Mary, Fr. John was the first to promote their liturgical worship by divine inspiration. He also preached the Gospel in many villages and cities as an apostolic missionary. Weakened by so many labors, he passed away peacefully on the tenth of the Nones of August in 1680.</p>"

The grace of his person and the vigor of his intellect filled his parents with high hopes, yet they accepted his decision to join the monks at Citeaux with serenity. All his brothers followed him to Citeaux except Nivard, the youngest, who was left to care for their father in his old age. Desiring to consecrate his life to God, the younger brother also left to join the monks; followed shortly after by the father. Only one sister remained; and she was married. She visited St. Bernard one day, and the words he spoke so moved her that she retired to a convent two years later. Bernard's holy example attracted so many novices that other monasteries were built. As abbot of the monastery at Clairvaux, he was at first unsparing. However, grace changed him into a mirror of God. He thenceforth found himself acting as the Good Shepherd. The Holy Spirit confirmed Bernard's works, so much that churches requested for him to become their bishop. In order to perfect the work he had begun, Bernard declined promotion with the help of Pope Eugenius III, his former disciple. Although an abbot, Bernard was constantly sought after by the poor and the guilty for protection. He served as consultant to bishops, kings and popes. Ab. Bernard passed away in 1153. His writings have earned for him the titles of the last of the Church Fathers and a Doctor of the Church.</p>"

While his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press to save it from the Midianites,<br />the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, \"The LORD is with you, O champion!\"<br />\"My Lord,\" Gideon said to him, \"if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? Where are his wondrous deeds of which our fathers told us when they said, 'Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' For now the LORD has abandoned us and has delivered us into the power of Midian.\"<br />The LORD turned to him and said, \"Go with the strength you have and save Israel from the power of Midian. It is I who send you.\"<br />But he answered him, \"Please, my lord, how can I save Israel? My family is the meanest in Manasseh, and I am the most insignificant in my father's house.\"<br />\"I shall be with you,\" the LORD said to him, \"and you will cut down Midian to the last man.\"<br />He answered him, \"If I find favor with you, give me a sign that you are speaking with me.<br />Do not depart from here, I pray you, until I come back to you and bring out my offering and set it before you.\" He answered, \"I will await your return.\"<br />So Gideon went off and prepared a kid and an ephah of flour in the form of unleavened cakes. Putting the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out to him under the terebinth and presented them.<br />The angel of God said to him, \"Take the meat and unleavened cakes and lay them on this rock; then pour out the broth.\" When he had done so,<br />the angel of the LORD stretched out the tip of the staff he held, and touched the meat and unleavened cakes. Thereupon a fire came up from the rock which consumed the meat and unleavened cakes, and the angel of the LORD disappeared from sight.<br />Gideon, now aware that it had been the angel of the LORD, said, \"Alas, Lord GOD, that I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!\"<br />The LORD answered him, \"Be calm, do not fear. You shall not die.\"<br />So Gideon built there an altar to the LORD and called it Yahweh-shalom.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>85(84),9.11-12.13-14.</em><p>I will hear what God proclaims; <br />the LORD–for he proclaims peace. <br />To his people, and to his faithful ones,<br />and to those who put in him their hope.<br />Kindness and truth shall meet; <br />justice and peace shall kiss.<br />Truth shall spring out of the earth, <br />and justice shall look down from heaven.<br />The LORD himself will give his benefits; <br />our land shall yield its increase.<br />Justice shall walk before him, <br />and salvation, along the way of his steps.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Matthew</h3><em>19,23-30.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: “Amen, I say to you, it will be hard for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven.<br />Again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for one who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.\"<br />When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, \"Who then can be saved?\"<br />Jesus looked at them and said, \"For human beings this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.\"<br />Then Peter said to him in reply, \"We have given up everything and followed you. What will there be for us?\"<br />Jesus said to them, \"Amen, I say to you that you who have followed me, in the new age, when the Son of Man is seated on his throne of glory, will yourselves sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.<br />And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands for the sake of my name will receive a hundred times more, and will inherit eternal life.<br />But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first.\"</p>"

So they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'<br />But the olive tree answered them, 'Must I give up my rich oil, whereby men and gods are honored, and go to wave over the trees?'<br />Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'Come; you reign over us!'<br />But the fig tree answered them, 'Must I give up my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?'<br />Then the trees said to the vine, 'Come you, and reign over us.'<br />But the vine answered them, 'Must I give up my wine that cheers gods and men, and go to wave over the trees?'<br />Then all the trees said to the buckthorn, 'Come; you reign over us!'<br />But the buckthorn replied to the trees, 'If you wish to anoint me king over you in good faith, come and take refuge in my shadow.

He said to them, 'You too go into my vineyard.'<br />When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Summon the laborers and give them their pay, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'<br />When those who had started about five o'clock came, each received the usual daily wage.<br />So when the first came, they thought that they would receive more, but each of them also got the usual wage.<br />And on receiving it they grumbled against the landowner,<br />saying, 'These last ones worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us, who bore the day's burden and the heat.'<br />He said to one of them in reply, 'My friend, I am not cheating you. Did you not agree with me for the usual daily wage?<br />Take what is yours and go. What if I wish to give this last one the same as you?<br />(Or) am I not free to do as I wish with my own money?

When she was born in Lima, Peru, in 1586, she was christened Isabel. However, the beauty of her features made others nickname her Rose. While in the cradle, her silence during a painful surgical operation showed her uniqueness. She began working at an early age to support her parents; and in spite of hardships and austerities, her beauty increased. Being openly admired, she cut off her hair for fear of vanity and blistered her face with pepper and her hands with lime. In full possession of the beatitudes and with her vocation before her eyes, she enrolled in the Third Order of St. Dominic, and took St. Catherine of Siena as her model. Her cell was a garden hut, and her couch was a box of broken tiles. Under her habit, she wore a hair-shirt studded with iron nails. A silver crown armed with ninety points encircled her head, which she concealed with a veil. More than once, when she shuddered at the prospect of a night of hardship, a voice said, \"My cross was more painful.\" The Blessed Sacrament was Sr. Rose's singular delight. All her sufferings were offered for the conversion of sinners; and the thought of the multitudes in hell was present in her mind. She passed away in 1617 at the age of 31. Beholding Jesus face to face, St. Rose intercedes on behalf of the pure and humble of heart.</p>"

St. Bartholomew is mentioned among the disciples who met together in prayer after Christ's ascension. Praying together with the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Bartholomew received from Jesus the Holy Spirit in the form of tongues of fire. Being justified by grace to discharge the functions of an apostle, St. Bartholomew carried the Gospel to the ends of the earth. He preacheed as far as Bombay, India, before returning to northwest Asia. There, he met St. Philip at Hierapolis in Phrygia, and afterward travelled into Lycaonia. St. Bartholomew's last mission was into Greater Armenia. While preaching the Gospel in a place of pagan worship and idolatry, St. Bartholomew was arrested, flayed alive, and eventually crucified.

When they had lived there about ten years,<br />both Mahlon and Chilion died also, and the woman was left with neither her two sons nor her husband.<br />She then made ready to go back from the plateau of Moab because word reached her there that the LORD had visited his people and given them food.<br />Again they sobbed aloud and wept; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye, but Ruth stayed with her.<br />\"See now!\" she said, \"your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her god. Go back after your sister-in-law!\"<br />But Ruth said, \"Do not ask me to abandon or forsake you! for wherever you go I will go, wherever you lodge I will lodge, your people shall be my people, and your God my God.<br />Thus it was that Naomi returned with the Moabite daughter-in-law, Ruth, who accompanied her back from the plateau of Moab.

King of France at the age of 12, Louis made the defence of God's honor the aim of his life. Before two years, he had crushed the Albigensian heretics and forced them by stringent penalties to respect the Catholic faith. Amidst the cares of government, King Louis daily recited the Divine Office and heard two Masses; and the most glorious churches in France are still monuments of his piety. When his courtiers remonstrated with him for his law that blasphemers should be branded on the lips, he replied, \"I would willingly have my own lips branded to root out blasphemy from my kingdom.\" A fearless protector of the weak and oppressed, King Louis was chosen to arbitrate in the great feuds of his day, between the Pope and the Emperor, between Henry III and the English barons. In 1248, to reclaim the land of Christianity and Judaism, he gathered the chivalry of France and embarked on a crusade. During the conflict, King Louis proved himself the truest of Christian knights, receiving both victory and defeat, remaining constant in sickness and captivity. When held captive at Damietta, an Emir rushed into his tent brandishing a dagger red with the Sultan's blood. The Emir threatened to stab King Louis unless he conferred knighthood, as Emperor Frederick had done with Facardin. King Louis calmly replied that no unbeliever could perform the duties of a Christian knight. When offered freedom on condition of blaspheming, and despite a threat to massacre the Christians, King Louis inflexibly refused. The death of King Louis' mother recalled him to France; but once order was reestablished, he again set forth on a second crusade. In August, 1270, his army landed at Tunis, and though victorious over the enemy, King Louis succumbed to a malignant fever. He received the Viaticum kneeling by his camp-bed, and gave up his soul to God.</p>"

That year, Emeperor Severus raised the fifth and most bloody persecution against the Church, which continued until his death in 211. During the persecution, St. Zephyrinus was the support and comfort of Christians, and he suffered by charity and compassion what every confessor underwent. The triumphs of the martyrs were indeed his joy, but his heart received many deep wounds from the fall of apostates and heretics. Neither did this latter affliction cease when peace was restored to the Church. Eusebius tells us that this holy Pope exerted his zeal so strenuously against the blasphemies of the heretics that they treated him in the most contemptuous manner. However, the words of Christ during His Sermon on the Mount ring true: \"Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you because of me. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven\" (Mt. 5:11-12). St. Zephyrinus filled the pontifical chair for nineteen years before passing away in 217. He was buried in his own cemetery on the 26th of August. He is styled a martyr by what he suffered without being killed. He awaits us in our True Native Land, where he lives and reigns with Jesus and Mary forever and ever.</p>"

She at once devoted herself to his conversion, praying for him always, and winning his reverence and love by the holiness of her life and her affectionate forbearance. She was rewarded by seeing him baptized a year before his death. When Augustine went astray in faith and manners, her prayers and tears were incessant. She was once very urgent with a learned bishop to speak with her son and bring him to a better mind, but the bishop despaired against one so able and headstrong. However, on witnessing St. Monica's prayers and tears, he said, \"take courage,\" for it might not be that the child of those tears should perish. By going to Italy, Augustine freed himself from his mother's importunities, but he could not escape her prayers, which encompassed him like the providence of God. She followed him to Italy, and there, by his marvellous conversion, her sorrow was turned into joy. At Ostia, on their homeward journey, as Augustine and his mother sat at a window speaking about the life of the blessed, she turned to him and said, \"Son, there is nothing now I care for in this life. My one reason was seeing you receive Christ.\" A few days later, St. Monica was brought low by a fever and passed away in the year 387.</p>"

He was brought up in the Christian faith, but was not baptized. An ambitious school-boy of brilliant talents and violent passions, he early lost both his faith and his innocence. He persisted in his irregular life until he was 32. Being then at Milan professing rhetoric, he tells us that the faith of his childhood had regained possession of his intellect, but that he could not as yet resolve to break the chains of evil habit. One day, however, stung to the heart by the account of some sudden conversions, he cried out, \"The unlearned rise and storm heaven, and we, with all our learning, for lack of heart lie wallowing here.\" He then withdrew into a garden, where a long and terrible conflict ensued. Suddenly, a young fresh voice (he knows not whose) breaks in upon his strife with the words, \"Take and read\"; and he lights upon the passage, \"Walk honestly as in the day.\" The battle was won, and Augustine received baptism. He returned home and gave everything to the poor and the Church. At Hippo, where he settled, he was consecrated bishop in 395. For thirty-five years, he was the center of ecclesiastical life in Africa, and the Church's mightiest champion against heresy. His writings have been accepted everywhere as one of the principal sources of devotional thought and theological speculation.</p><hr /><h3>St. Edmund Arrowsmith()</h3><hr />"

Beatified by Pope John Paul II on October 3, 1982, and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 11, 2009, her virtues and intercession are everlasting. She grew up in a small town in revolutionary France. When those who openly practiced their faith were either imprisoned or killed, Jeanne received her faith formation from her mother and a group of women who belonged to a lay movement.When Jeanne was 4, her father was lost at sea. Her mother found odd jobs to make ends meet. While a young girl, Jeanne worked as a shepherdess. She also knit and spun wool. A while later, she went on to work as a maid for a wealthy family. Despite having a modest education, Jeanne's heart was ablaze with love and devotions for Jesus and Mary. Now, barely out of her teens, St. Jeanne felt the call of divine love. She told her mother, \"God wants me for himself. He is keeping me for a work which is not yet founded.\" After, she set to work among the poor in a local hospital.One cold winter night, Jeanne encountered Jesus in the person of an elderly, blind, infirm woman, who was dying in the cold. Jeanne carried the woman home, lifted her up the stairs to her small room, and placed the woman in her bed. Henceforth, Jeanne would sleep in the attic as she made her home into a refuge for the destitute and marginalized in revolutionary France.God instilled great fervor and zealousness in Jeanne. Many women responded to the call, the invitation to serve. By the working of the Holy Spirit, a religious community was born. The local citizens were struck by their spirit of humble service, and called the group the Little Sisters of the Poor; and the name stuck. From then on, their order spread across France and beyond.Although the Order's foundress, Jeanne was early-on demoted by eclesiastical authorities, and an ambitious priest was placed in charge. Jeanne was sent out begging by the new Superior of the Order she had founded. In time, Jeanne was placed in retirement. At the time of her passing, 27 years later, the nacent Little Sisters had no idea Jeanne was their foundress. St. Jeanne said, \"We are grafted onto the Cross, and we must carry it joyfully.\" Her rich spiritual reflections continue yielding grace and illuminating spiritual realities.In her words:\"Be very little before God.\" ... \"It is so good to be poor, ... (relinquishing everything), and depending on God for everything.\" ... \"God will help us; the work is His.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Fiaker(Anchorite († c. 670))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT FIAKER Anchorite( c. 670) St. Fiaker was born in Ireland and educated by a bishop, who some say was Conan, Bishop of Soder or the Western Islands. Rejecting worldly vanity, he renounced a splendid career to live as a mystic. He then sailed to France to maintain holy solitude. Divine Providence conducted Fiaker to St. Faro, who was the Bishop of Meaux. When they met, the prelate discerned Fiaker's marks of extraordinary virtue and ability, and gave the latter a solitary dwelling in a forest called Breuil. In this place, the holy Anchorite cleared the ground of trees and briers, made himself a cell, a small garden, and built an oratory in honor of the Blessed Virgin, in which he spent a great part of the days and nights in devout prayer. He tilled his garden and labored with his own hands for subsistence. Fiaker constantly maintained the presence of God, and only necessity or charity interrupted his exercises. Many approached him for advice, and the poor of spirit for divine gifts. Following the Trish monks' rule, he never had a woman enter his personal enclosure. St. Chillen, or Kilian, an Irish nobleman, visited St. Fiaker on his return from Rome. With time under Fiaker's disciple, St. Kilian went on to preach in the neighboring dioceses with every bishops' approval. Selfless and loyal to the end, St. Fiaker awaits us, the Church Militant, on the threshold of heaven, praying and interceding for us until the end of time.</p><hr /><h3>St. Pammachius()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

He descended from a gentleman's family of small fortune. In his childhood, he seemed to find pleasure only in devotions and serious duties. His took him from school after perceiving an inclination to religious life, and sent him to take care of a farm that he had in the country. Raymund readily obeyed, and in order to enjoy the opportunity of holy solitude, kept the sheep himself, and spent his time in the mountains and forests in holy meditation and prayer. Some time after, Raymund joined the new Order of Our Lady of Mercy for the redemption of captives, and was admitted to his profession at Barcelona by the holy founder, St. Peter Nolasco. Within 2 or 3 years after his profession, he was sent into Barbary with a considerable sum of money, where he purchased, at Algiers, the liberty of a great number of slaves. When all this treasure was exhausted, he gave himself up as a hostage for the ransom of certain others. This magnanimous sacrifice served only to exasperate the Mohammedans, who treated him barbarously. Raymund almost died at their hands, but they stopped short because he was worth money as a slave. When Raymund was finally permitted to walk on the streets, he stole minutes to comfort and encourage Christians who were in chains. However, after Raymund converted and baptized Muslims, the governor sentenced him to death by impalement. Even though the sentence was commuted, Raymund endured a cruel bastinado. A victim of torture, Raymund was unyeildng. Racked with pain, he summoned the courage to continue exhorting Christian captives and converting Muslims. The governor, livid with rage, ordered him to be tortured and manacled until his ransom was paid. This brutality continued until Raymund's Order bought his freedom. After returning to Spain, Raymund was appointed cardinal by Pope Gregory IX. When the pope summoned him to Rome, Raymund obeyed, but got no further than Cardona. There, he was seized by a fever and passed away. He went to eternity with Jesus and Mary on August 31, 1240, at the age of 37.</p><hr /><h3>St. Aristedes()</h3><hr />"
