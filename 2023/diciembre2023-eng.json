While I watched, the wings were plucked; it was raised from the ground to stand on two feet like a man, and given a human mind.<br />The second was like a bear; it was raised up on one side, and among the teeth in its mouth were three tusks. It was given the order, \"Up, devour much flesh.\"<br />After this I looked and saw another beast, like a leopard; on its back were four wings like those of a bird, and it had four heads. To this beast dominion was given.<br />After this, in the visions of the night I saw the fourth beast, different from all the others, terrifying, horrible, and of extraordinary strength; it had great iron teeth with which it devoured and crushed, and what was left it trampled with its feet.<br />I was considering the ten horns it had, when suddenly another, a little horn, sprang out of their midst, and three of the previous horns were torn away to make room for it. This horn had eyes like a man, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly.<br />As I watched, Thrones were set up and the Ancient One took his throne. His clothing was snow bright, and the hair on his head as white as wool; His throne was flames of fire, with wheels of burning fire.<br />A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat; Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him, and myriads upon myriads attended him. The court was convened, and the books were opened.<br />I watched, then, from the first of the arrogant words which the horn spoke, until the beast was slain and its body thrown into the fire to be burnt up.<br />The other beasts, which also lost their dominion, were granted a prolongation of life for a time and a season.<br />As the visions during the night continued, I saw One like a son of man coming, on the clouds of heaven; When he reached the Ancient One and was presented before him,<br />He received dominion, glory, and kingship; nations and peoples of every language serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away, his kingship shall not be destroyed.</p><h3>Book of Daniel</h3><em>3,75.76.77.78.79.80.81.</em><p>Mountains and hills, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Everything growing from the earth, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />You springs, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Seas and rivers, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />You dolphins and all water creatures, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />All you birds of the air, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />All you beasts, wild and tame, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,29-33.</em><p>Jesus told his disciples a parable. “Consider the fig tree and all the other trees.<br />When their buds burst open, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near;<br />in the same way, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.<br />Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.<br />Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Charles of Jesus(Priest (1858-1916))</h3><p>SAINT CHARLES OF JESUS Charles de Foucauld Priest (1858-1916) St. Charles of Jesus was born at Strasbourg, France, on September 15, 1858. Orphaned at 6, he and his sister Marie were raised by their grandfather: in whose footsteps he followed by taking up a military career. As an adolescent, Charles lost his faith. Upon receiving an inheritance, he squandered his wealth like the prodigal son (Lk. 15:11-32). Hedonism checked his progress at the military academy, but his resilience was also proven. In 1883, he undertook a risky exploration of Morocco. Upon seeing the way Muslims expressed their faith, Charles questioned God and began repeating, ‘‘My God, if you exist, let me come to know you.’’ After Charles returned to France, the warm, respectful welcome he received from his deeply Christian family made him continue his search. Under the guidance of Fr. Huvelin, Charles rediscovered God in October 1886. He was 28 years old. ‘‘As soon as I believed in God, I understood that I could not do otherwise than to live for him alone.’’ A pilgrimage to the Holy Land revealed Charles' vocation: following Jesus in a life at Nazareth. Charles spent 7 years as a Trappist in France, and then at Akbès in Syria. Afterward, he led a solitary life of prayer and adoration near a convent of Poor Clares in Nazareth. Ordained at 43, Fr. Charles left for the Sahara, living at first in Beni Abbès and later at Tamanrasset among the Tuaregs of the Hoggar. He wanted to be among those who were ‘‘the furthest removed, the most abandoned.’’ He wanted all who drew close to him to find in him a brother, ‘‘a universal brother.’’ With great respect for the culture and the faith among those he lived, his desire was to ‘‘shout the Gospel with his life.’’ ‘‘I would like to be sufficiently good that people would say, ‘If such is the servant, what must the Master be like?'’’ On the evening of December 1, 1916, Fr. Charles was killed by bandits who encircled his house. Miracles following his death prove that he attained the beatific vision: seeing God face to face. St. Charles, standing next to the Lord, hears our prayers and asks God with perfect faith. St. Charles always dreamed of sharing his vocation with others. After writing several rules for religious life, he concluded that the ‘‘life of Nazareth,’’ seeking God in an active and contemplative life, could be led by all. Today, the spiritual family of St. Charles de Foucauld encompasses several associations, religious communities and secular institutes for both priests and lay people.</p><hr /><h3>St. Eligius(Bishop († 665))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ELIGIUSBishop( 665) Eligius, a goldsmith at Paris, was commissioned by King Clotaire to make a throne. The gold and precious stones given to him were so many that he made two instead. Struck by Eligius' rare honesty, King Clotaire gave him a position at the royal court. At court, Eligius mortified his senses and prayed regularly. He had a marvellous zeal for redeeming captives, and for their deliverance would sell his jewels, food, clothes and his very shoes. Through prayer and acts of mercy, he restored people's union with God: becoming like Jesus Christ and \"leading captives in his train\" (Eph 4:8, Ps 68:18). For all his activity, he delighted in making shrines for relics. A remarkably virtuous person, Eligius was consecrated Bishop of Noyon. He possessed gifts of miracles and prophecy. Death could not put an end to so great a love; and so Jesus took him up on the last day.</p><hr /><h3>St. Florence()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

They shall be handed over to him for a year, two years, and a half-year.<br />But when the court is convened, and his power is taken away by final and absolute destruction,<br />Then the kingship and dominion and majesty of all the kingdoms under the heavens shall be given to the holy people of the Most High, Whose kingdom shall be everlasting: all dominions shall serve and obey him.\"</p><h3>Book of Daniel</h3><em>3,82.83.84.85.86.87.</em><p>You sons of men, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />O Israel, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Priests of the Lord, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Servants of the Lord, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Spirits and souls of the just, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.<br />Holy men of humble heart, bless the Lord; <br />praise and exalt him above all forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,34-36.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"Beware that your hearts do not become drowsy from carousing and drunkenness and the anxieties of daily life, and that day catch you by surprise<br />like a trap. For that day will assault everyone who lives on the face of the earth.<br />Be vigilant at all times and pray that you have the strength to escape the tribulations that are imminent and to stand before the Son of Man.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Bibiana(Virgin and Martyr (4th century))</h3><p>SAINT BIBIANA Virgin and Martyr (4th century) St. Bibiana was a native of Rome. Her father, Flavian, was arrested for being Christian and burned in the face with a hot iron. He was then banished to Aequapendente where he died of his wounds a few days later. St. Bibiana's mother, Dafrosa, was later beheaded. Bibiana and her sister, Demetria, had all their property confiscated. Afterward, Apronianus, the Governor of Rome, summoned them and put them on trial. Demetria confessed her faith in Jesus Christ, but then collapsed and died in front of the tribunal. Apronianus ordered that Bibiana be put into the hands of Rufina, who would bring her to another way of thinking. However, Bibiana's faith grew all the greater: After proving her love in temptation, suffering and darkness, springs of living water flowed from within her (Jn. 7:38). Apronianus was enraged at her courage, and ordered her tied to a pillar and scourged to death with whips of leaden plummets. St. Bibiana underwent this punishment courageously for Jesus Christ before passing away. Her triumph over sin and death saw an immediate encounter with Jesus Christ. She received the beatific vision and sees God face to face forever.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Ivan Slezyuk(Bishop (1896-1973))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Ivan SlezyukBishop of the \"clandestine\" Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church(1896-1973) Bl. Ivan Slezyuk was born on January 14, 1896, in the village of Zhyvachiv, Stanislaviv - now Ivano-Frankivsk Region, Ukraine. He was ordained in 1923 after graduating from seminary. In April 1945, Bp. Hryhory Khomyshyn ordained Fr. Ivan as his co-adjutor, with the right of succession in case the former was arrested. When Bp. Ivan was arrested on June 2, 1945, he was deported for ten years to the labor camps in Vorkuta, Russia. In 1950, he was transferred to the labor camps in Mordovia. After his release on November 15, 1954, Bp. Ivan returned to Ivano-Frankivsk. In 1962, Bp. Ivan wasarrested again and imprisoned for five years in a camp of strict regimen. After his release on November 30, 1968, he had to visit the KGB for regular \"talks.\" The last visit was two weeks before his death. Immediately after his return, he fell ill; and passed away on December 2, 1973, in Ivano-Frankivsk. Pope John Paul II opened the case for Bp. Ivan Slezyuk's canonization. On June 27, 2001, the Bishop was beatified. His intercession never fails because he conformed perfectly in life to Jesus Christ.</p>"

He appeared to have no higher goal until meeting St. Ignatius of Loyola. After the encounter, Francis Xavier experienced metanoia: a fundamental change of heart and mind and a new direction. After a brief apostolate among his countrymen at Rome, Francis Xavier was sent by St. Ignatius to the Indies. For twelve years, he proclaimed the Gospel in Hindostan, Malacca and Japan. Sometimes, he experienced setbacks, jealously and neglect, but God, Who draws grace from sin, aided him. The occasions of sin or despair helped make him a saint: forging character, building virtue and putting deeper trust in God. The people of China appealed to Francis' charity; and he was resolved to risk his life to enter when God called him to heaven. He passed away on December 2, 1552, like Moses in sight of the promised land. His extensive apostolate helped make him a saint, as should our love for God in our daily work.</p>"

In that forced solitude, St. Barbara gave herself to prayer and study; and secretly received formation and baptism from a priest. When Dioscorus discovered his daughter's activities, he was beside himself with rage. He denounced St. Barbara before a civil tribunal. As punishment, she was horribly tortured and afterward beheaded. Martyrologies state that Dioscorus acted as St. Barbara's executioner. His life was cut short when he was killed by a lightning bolt. God's mercy and St. Barbara's prayers may have ended Dioscorus' life before he could lose his soul.</p><hr /><h3>St. John Damascus(Syrian monk and priest (c. 675-749))</h3><hr /><p>St. John of Damascus Syrian monk and priest(c. 675-749) St. John Damascene has the double honor of being the last of the fathers of the Eastern Church and the greatest of her poets. Little else is known about his life. The account of John of Jerusalem, two hundred years after the Saint's death, contains fact and legend. St. John Damascus' ancestors, according to his biographer, remained Christian though Damascus fell to Islamic armies. They were employed in judicial offices to administer the sultan's Christian subjects. St. John's father used his great wealth to free Christian slaves. After his birth, St. John was baptized, likely by Peter II, Bishop of Damascus. As a young adult, St. John's character and achievements earned him the Saracens' respect. In time, he was compelled to accept an office of higher trust and dignity than his father had held. As the Iconoclastic controversy became more violent, St. John published the first of three treatises on the Veneration Due to Images. They were probably composed when Leo the Isaurian decreed against images in 730. St. John was ordained before publishing the second treatise. The third treatise expanded upon the freedom of expression, in the defense of basic rights. The treatises were disseminated throughout the Christian world. St. John wrote religious poetry: a heritage of the Eastern Church. He also protected the Church's doctrines through publications. He also published apologetics to heretical groups. His three great hymns or \"canons\" are on Easter, the Ascension, and Saint Thomas' Sunday. His defense of icons, freedom of speech and basic rights madehim the Doctor of Christian Art.</p>"

After ten years, Sabas went to Jerusalem and visited the holy places. There, he attached himself to a monastery under the leadership of St. Euthymius. When the holy abbot passed away, Sabas went into the wilderness. He dwelt in a cave at the top of a high mountain, at the bottom of which ran the brook Cedron. After five years, disciples came to Sabas desiring to serve God under his direction. He was at first unwilling, but finally consented. Thus he founded a new monastery for persons desiring to praise and serve God uninterrupted. With Sabas' great sanctity becoming known, he was ordained at the age of 53 by the patriarch of Jerusalem. Later, he was appointed superior-general of all the anchorites of Palestine. Fr. Sabas lived to be 94. He passed away on December 5, 532. His sanctity of life recalls the words of scripture: \"Goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever\" (Ps. 23:6).</p><hr /><h3>St. Gerald()</h3><hr />"

His uncle, the archbishop of Myra in Lycia, ordained him and appointed him abbot of a monastery. When the archbishop passed away, Nicholas was elected to the vacant see. Throughout his life, St. Nicholas retained the bright and guileless manners of his early years. St. Nicholas is the special protector of the innocent. When he heard that a father who had fallen into poverty would abandon three daughters to a life of sin, he decided to save them. He went out at night and flung a bag of gold into the father's house. Upon awakening, the father deemed the gift a godsend, and dowered his eldest child. St. Nicholas was overjoyed, and did likewise for the second daughter. The third time, he was discovered. The father approached him, kissed his feet and said, \"Why dost thou conceal thyself from me? Thou has delivered my soul and my daughters from sin.\" St. Nicholas is usually depicted beside a vessel. It represents where three children were trapped; and he either saved them or raised them to life. St. Nicholas joined the Church Triumphant in 342. His relics were transferred in 1807 to Bari, Italy. There, after fifteen centuries, \"the manna of St. Nicholas\" still flows and cures illnesses.</p>"

He is best known for preserving the deposit of faith and defending the unity of doctrine. Bp. Ambrose was both pastor and apologist. He courageously resisted Empress Justina when she attempted to give one of Milan's churches to the Arians. He also rebuked and led to penance the great Emperor Theodosius after the latter cruelly punished Thessalonica's inhabitants. St. Ambrose was the friend and consoler of St. Monica in all her trials.

The Dominicans had looked after the parish for almost three hundred years. Her parents, Peter Martillo and Josephine Morán, landowners, were animated by a living faith. Peter Martillo was very devoted to Saint Hyacinth of Poland and the future saint Marianna of Jesus. He and Josephine generously raised their nine children: of which Narcisa was the sixth. In 1838, Josephine passed away, so Narcisa was educated by a teacher and an older sister. Narcisa learned to read, write, sing, play the guitar, sew, weave, embroider and cook. Often, her prayer turned into song. Edified and encouraged by her family, Narcisa perceived God's invitation to religious life at an early age: especially after receiving confirmation, aged 7, on September 16. She developed a habit of visiting a small wooded area near her home to contemplate divine realities. She also turned a small room in her house into a chapel. The tree of Guayabo, near which she prayed, is now a destination for large pilgrimages. Narcisa decided to imitate Saint Marianna of Jesus and accepted penances and voluntary suffering for the redemption of souls. She united herself to Jesus' salvific life whenever doing chores and working in the fields. She was thoughtful, joyful, sweet, peaceful, docile to the the Holy Spirit, generous and compassionate. She was especially attentive to the poor. She proved to be an excellent catechist when communicating divine love to her family and the children of her neighborhood. In January 1852, her father passed away. At 19, she moved to Guayaquil to stay with a well-known family who lived near the cathedral. She stayed in the city until 1868, except for the months she lived in the city of Cuenca. She moved houses a number of times to preserve her privacy and to dedicate herself with greater freedom to prayer and penance: earning her living through tailoring. Meanwhile, she helped the poor and the sick and implemented the advice of her spiritual directors. She began relying more on the will of Jesus rather than her own. She shared ideals, and sometimes a house, with the Blessed Mercedes of Jesus Molina. With a desire for greater perfection, and advised by a Franciscan religious, Narcisa set out in June 1868 for Lima (Perù) and lived as a lay member in the Dominican convent of Patrocinio, founded in 1688, in the area where Saint John Macias used to graze his flock. The Lord favored her with extraordinary gifts, and showed her how pleasing her life was in the midst of trials. Toward the end of September 1869, Narcisa had high fevers. Medical remedies could do little, but she kept up her normal rhythm of life, ending each day with a novena and the celebration of the Eucharist. With great joy, she dressed in white on the solemnity of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, on December 8, 1869: the same day Blessed Pius IX opened Vatican Council I. At the end of the day, she took leave of the sisters and said she was going on a journey.This was taken as a joke, but not long after, one of the sisters noticed a splendor and a special fragrance from Narcisa's cell. The community gathered and found that Narcisa had passed away. She was only 37. Afterward, it became known that she had made a private vow of perpetual virginity, poverty, obedience, enclosure, eremitical life, fasting on bread and water, daily Communion, confession, mortification and prayer. All these vows she kept faithfully. Narcisa's body remained incorrupt after her death and emitted a beautiful fragrance. There were many graces granted at her resting place. The city of Lima acclaimed her as a saint, as did the people of Guayaquil and Nobol. The Dominican Sisters of Patrocinio guarded the memory of her virtues and her tomb with great veneration until her body, practically incorrupt, was transferred to Guayaquil in 1955. The documents of the diocesan process of canonization were handed over to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 1964. Pope John Paul II beatified her on October 25, 1992, and Pope Benedict XVI canonized her on October 12, 2008. On August 22, 1998, they dedicated a shrine in her honor at Nobol, where her incorrupt body rests. Devotion to the \"Niña Narcisa\" shows the spontaneous identification of ordinary people with this courageous and humble woman from the Ecuadorian coast.</p><hr /><h3>St. Patapius(Hermit)</h3><hr /><p>Saint PatapiusHermit St. Patapius founded a monastery at Constantinople.

Juan Diego was born in 1474 with the name \"Cuauhtlatoatzin\" (\"the talking eagle\"). He was born at Cuautlitlán, today part of Mexico City, Mexico. He was a gifted member of the Chichimeca people, one of the most culturally advanced groups living in the Anáhuac Valley. When he was 50, Juan Diego was baptized by a Franciscan priest, Fr Peter da Gand, one of the first Franciscan missionaries. On December 9, 1531, when Juan Diego was on his way to morning Mass, the Blessed Mother appeared to him on Tepeyac Hill, on the outskirts of what is now Mexico City. She asked him to go to the Bishop and to request in her name that a shrine be built at Tepeyac, where she promised to pour out her grace upon those who invoked her. The Bishop, who did not believe Juan Diego, asked for a sign to prove that the apparition was true. On December 12, Juan Diego returned to Tepeyac. Here, the Blessed Mother told him to climb the hill and to pick the flowers that he would find in bloom. He obeyed, and although it was winter time, he found roses flowering. He gathered the flowers and took them to Our Lady who carefully placed them in his mantle and told him to take them to the Bishop as proof. When he opened his mantle, the flowers fell on the ground, and there remained impressed an image of the Blessed Mother, the apparition at Tepeyac. With the Bishop's permission, Juan Diego lived the rest of his life as a hermit in a small hut near the chapel where the miraculous image was placed for veneration. Here he cared for the church and the first pilgrims who came to pray to the Mother of God. Much deeper than the exterior grace of having been chosen as Our Lady's messenger, Juan Diego received the grace of interior enlightenment; and from that moment, he began a life dedicated to prayer and the practice of virtue and love of God and neighbor. He passed away in 1548 and was buried in the first chapel dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe. He was beatified on May 6, 1990, by Pope John Paul II in the Basilica of Santa Maria di Guadalupe, Mexico City, and canonized on July 31, 2002. The miraculous image, which is preserved in the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, shows a woman of mixed native and European heritage. She is supported by an angel whose wings are reminiscent of one of the major gods of the traditional religion of that area. The moon is beneath her feet and her blue mantle is covered with gold stars. The black girdle about her waist signifies that she is pregnant. Thus, the image depicts that Christ is to be born again among the people of the New World. Laser scanning and scientific instruments determined that the Virgin's eyes had rested upon those present at the Cloak's first unveiling. The representation of native traditions in colors and symbols, and the image's preservation from accidental destruction, confirms that the Blessed Virgin is alive and is the Mediatrix of the human race.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leocadia(Virgin and Martyr († c. 304))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT LEOCADIAVirgin and Martyr( c. 304) St. Leocadia was a native of Toledo. She was arrested in 304 on Governor Dacian's order. Hearing about St. Eulalia's martyrdom, St. Leocadia prayed for the courage to die for Jesus. Soon after, she was martyred in prison. Three famous churches in Toledo bear her name. In one of those churches, most of the councils of Toledo were held. St. Leocadia is honored as the city's principal patroness. St. Leocadia's relics were kept in the Toledo Church until the incursions of the Moors. Thus they were conveyed to Oviedo. They were transferred some years afterward to the abbey of St. Guislain, near Mons, at Hainault. They were finally carried back to Toledo with great celebration and placed in the Great Church on April 26, 1589.</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter Fourier()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

She was 12 when Diocletian's persecution broke out. Eulalia presented herself before judge Dacianus and reproached him for coercing persons to renounce Jesus Christ. Hence she was arrested. At first, the governor tried winning her over with flattery. When he failed, he threatened her; and showed her instruments of torture saying, \"All this you shall escape if you will but touch a little salt and frankincense with the tip of your finger.\" Provoked, Eulalia threw down the idol and trampled upon the sacrificial cake. At the judge's order, two executioners tore Eulalia's sides with iron hooks, exposing her bones. Next, lighted torches were applied to her breasts and sides; under which torment, instead of groans, nothing was heard from her except thanksgivings. The fire at length caught her hair; and she was burned and suffocated to death. St. Eulalia loved Jesus and Mary above all things. Her heroic virtue and selfless sacrifice imitated Jesus who died to save us from sins. With love beyond all telling, Jesus Christ grants miracles through St. Eulalia's intercession (Libreria Editrice Vaticana).</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory III()</h3><hr />"

She was the daughter of Luis Pidal y Mon, the Marquis of Pidal, and Cristina Chico de Guzmán y Muñoz. Her father was the Spanish Ambassador to the Holy See; and she grew up in a devout Catholic family. María made a vow of chastity at the age of 5 and soon devoted herself to charitable work. After reading the works of St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Jesus, she felt called to become a Discalced Carmelite. Her father, whom she assisted when he became ill, passed away in 1913. Her mother was reluctant to accept her entry to a Carmelite monastery. On October 12, 1919, María entered the Discalced Carmelites of El Escorial at Madrid. She made her simple vows on May 7, 1921. Before her final profession on May 30, 1924, Sr. María discerned God's will to found the Carmel of Cerro de los Ángeles. Sr. María's foundation was inaugurated on October 31, 1926, with three other Carmelites. It was the first of the series of Teresian Carmelite Monasteries that she established. She was not being called to found a new order or to branch off from the Discalced Carmelites as she pointed out. She sought to live deeply and to transmit the spirit and ideals of St. Teresa of Jesus and St. John of the Cross. On June 28, 1926, the bishop of the Diocese of Madrid-Alcalá appointed her prioress of the new monastery. In 1933, she established another foundation in Kottayam, India. From there, other foundations began. Mother Maravillas' role as prioress would be permanent in the various monasteries she founded throughout her life: notwithstanding the natural apprehension she feltin accepting positions of responsibility. Her spirit of obedience and love for the Church and for her Carmelite sisters gave her the discipline and prudence to carry out this duty courageously. Mother Maravillas was criticized for the poverty of the convents she founded. Some alleged that they were not solid, small in size and unfurnished, with bare walls on which hung Bible verses or writings of the Carmelite saints. She would reply, \"It is not our concern to plant a seed, since the Discalced Carmelites have already been founded.\" During the Spanish Civil War, the nuns of Cerro de los Ángeles lived in an apartment at Madrid. In September 1937, another Carmel in the Batuecas, Salamanca, was founded. In 1939, the monastery of Cerro de los Ángeles was restored. Amid deprivations, Mother Maravillas was courageous and happy: being an example of holiness to her daughters. Mother Maravillas was a mystery to the sisters closest to her in the sense of interior trials. Only her spiritual directors knew the \"dark night of the soul\" that she lived throughout her life, which kept her in profound spiritual aridity; and made total faith and abandonment to the will of God her guide. In the following years, foundations were established in other parts of Spain. Mother Maravillas also restored and sent nuns to the Carmel of El Escorial and to the venerable Monastery of the Incarnation at Avila. To unite the monasteries founded by her and others, she founded the Association of St. Teresa, which received official approval from the Holy See in 1972. On December 8, 1974, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception, Mother Maravillas was anointed and received Holy Communion. On December 11, surrounded by her community in the Carmel of La Aldehuela, Madrid, she passed away. At the time of her passing, her sisters reported that Mother Maravillas kept repeating the phrase, \"What happiness to die a Carmelite!\" She was beatified on May 10, 1998, and canonized on May 4, 2003, by Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Damasus I(Pope († 384))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT DAMASUS IPope( 384) St. Damasus was born at Rome in the fourth century. He was the archdeacon of the Roman Church in 355 when Pope Liberius was banished to Berda. Damasus accompanied Pope Liberius into exile; and returned afterward. On Pope Liberius' passing, Damasus was consecrated pope. Ursinus, a competitor for the office, incited a revolt, but Pope Damasus only took such action that was becoming a father of the Church. After freeing the Church of schism, Pope Damasus began extirpating Arianism in the West and Apollinarianism in the East. Thus he convened several councils. He rebuilt the church of St. Laurence, known as St. Laurence in Damaso, anddonated the lands in its vicinity. He also diverted springs running over Vatican tombs and decorated the sepulchers of martyrs. Pope Damasus passed away on December 10, 384, after serving as pope for eighteen years and two months. He was nearly 80.</p>"

St. Valery travelled into Neustria and baptized pagans with the cooperation of virtuous community leaders. More efficacious than his preaching were his prayers, penances and mortifications.

St. Agatha appeared in a vision to St. Lucy: calling her \"sister,\" foretelling her martyrdom, and foretelling her mother's recovery. That instant, the cure was affected. The grateful mother allowed St. Lucy to take vows, donate her wealth and consecrate her virginity to Christ. The young man to whom St. Lucy was betrothed accused her of being Christian to authorities. By a special miracle, our Lord spared St. Lucy from disfigurement.

Born and nurtured in poverty, John had a rich interior world, loved himself in obedience to Christ, and transcended his limits. While pursuing his sacred studies, he became a servant of the poor in the hospital of Medina. At 21, John petitioned to be a lay-brother of the Carmelite friars. He was soon ordained a priest. He would have transferred to the severe Carthusian Order had not St. Teresa persuaded him to remain and help her reform the Order. Thus, John became the first prior of the Barefooted Carmelites. John's reform, though approved by the general, was rejected by the elder friars. They condemned him as a fugitive and apostate; and cast him into prison. John escaped after nine months' suffering at the risk of his life. Twice again, John was shamefully persecuted by his brethren and publicly disgraced. However, his complete abandonment by creatures only deepened his interior peace and devout longing for heaven.

She was from the family of Giorgio Centurione, duke of the Republic from 1621 to 1622, and Lelia Spinola. Baptized two days after her birth, she received catechism and education from her mother and private tutors.She felt called to religious life, but obeyed her father by marrying Gaspare Grimaldi Bracelli on December 10, 1602. Gaspare's affluent family failed to intervene and correct his vices. As a consequence, Virginia was widowed at age 20. Gaspare left behind two daughters, Lelia and Isabella. Before he passed away at Alessandria on June 13, 1607, he reconciled by confessing his sins and receiving pardon (Jn. 20:23). Virginia made a vow of chastity and refused a second arranged marriage. She lived at her mother-in-law's house and managed her children's education and the estate. In 1610, she answered the call to religious life. In autumn of 1624 or 1625, Virginia welcomed 15 orphans into her home. The war between the Liguorian Republic and the Duke of Savoy, supported by France, had increased economic hardship. With increasing numbers of refugees, Virginia opened shelters for at-risk, vulnerable persons. In August 1625, with her mother-in-law's passing, she began corporal and spiritual works of mercy in the slums. Serving the Church during plagues and famines from 1629 to 1630, Virginia began renting the empty convent of Monte Calvario. She transferred there on April 13, 1631, together with beneficiaries under the protection of Our Lady of Refuge. Three years later, the Institute expanded into three houses, accommodating 300 patients and vulnerable persons. Virginia petitioned for official acknowledgement from the Senate of the Republic, which they received on December 13, 1635. The beneficiaries ofOur Lady of Refuge became like Virginia's family. She taught catechism and provided access to opportunities and training in professional skills. Sometimes, she cured spiritual illnesses. Virginia bought two villas next to Carignano's Hill and constructed a church dedicated to Our Lady of Refuge. The two villas became the mother house of the Institute. Later, it was divided into the \"Sisters of Our Lady of Refuge in Mount Calvary\" (Suore di Nostra Signora del Rifugio di Monte Calvario) and the \"Daughters of Our Lady on Mount Calvary\" (Figlie di Nostra Signora al Monte Calvario). On July 3, 1641, daily administration was encharged to nominees. As a consequence of war, economic hardship and corruption, the number of collaborators decreased. The shortages compelled Virgina to assume leadership and take responsibility for the sisters in Carignano's House. Virginia served and proclaimed the Gospel till she passed away on December 15, 1651, at the age of 64. She was beatified on September 22, 1985, and canonized on May 18, 2003, by Pope John Paul II.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mesmin († 520)()</h3><hr /><p>SAINT MESMIN ( 520) St. Mesmin was a native of Verdun. When citizens rebelled against King Clovis, a priest named Euspice, the king's uncle, brokered a truce. Clovis afterward persuaded Fr. Euspice to reside at court. Fr. Euspice accepted, and took St. Mesmin with him. On the journey to Orleans, Fr. Euspice noticed a solitary spot called Micy about two leagues from the city and beyond the Loire. He solicited Micy from Clovis and there built a monastery. St. Mesmin and several disciples helped in its construction. Fr. Euspice passed away two years after St. Mesmin was consecrated abbot by Bp. Eusebius. During a famine, St. Mesmin fed nearly the whole city of Orleans with wheat from his monastery without reducing its supply. He also drove out an enormous serpent from a place where he was later buried. After governing the monastery for ten years, St. Mesmin passed away peacefully. He went to his eternal reward on December 15, 520. The atmosphere was perceptively peaceful and there was a fragrance in the air. The miracles proceeding from his intercession prove he attained eternal life and the beatific vision.</p><hr /><h3>St. Christiana()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Eusebius sustained the Church through the clergy: those acting in the spirit, person and authority of Christ. He carefully instructed parishioners and churchmen alike. He also administered the sacraments, from Holy Mass and the Last Supper to Holy Orders. His prayer, before his preaching, brought many to repentance and conversion. Bp. Eusebius strove to illuminate the moods and fallacies of heretics. In retaliation, heretics banished him to Scythopolis, and afterward to Upper Thebais in Egypt.

He was baptized at the parish Church of our Lady of Valldeflors, the city's patroness. When he was 5, his mother offered him to our Lady's care and protection. When Josep came of age, he worked to complete his schooling with the Piarist Fathers at Barbastro and the Seminaries of Lleida and Urgell. He was ordained a priest on April 9, 1859. After working in the Diocese of Urgell for 12 years as the bishop's secretary, the secretary for pastoral visitations, the librarian of the seminary, and the administrator of the chancery, Fr. Josep felt God's call to found two congregations.Founder and Apostle of the Holy Family With the approval of his bishop, Fr. Josep founded the religious congregations of the Sons of the Holy Family Jesus, Mary and Joseph and the Missionary Daughters of the Holy Family of Nazareth in 1864 and 1874. Their mission is honoring, imitating and sharing the example of the Holy Family of Nazareth. With constant work and prayer, and an exemplary and virtuous life, Fr. Josep guided and encouraged, for almost forty years, the formation and expansion of his Institutes, opening schools and centers of ministry in several towns in Spain. Today, both Institutes are present in several European countries, in North and South America and in Africa as well. Called to express the example of the Holy Family of Nazareth, he wrote several books and booklets to spread their devotion. He founded the magazine La Sagrada Familia and dedicated a shrine to the Holy Family. The Temple, as yet unfinished in Barcelona, was built by the architectural genius and Servant of God Antonio Gaudí, destined to perpetuate the virtues and examples of the Family of Nazareth and to be the universal spiritual home of all families.His Train of Thought Saint Josep Manyanet spread the Gospel through his preaching and writings. He wrote letters, books and booklets for the formation of the members of his religious Institutes, for families and children, and for the management of schools. One of the highlights is the School of Nazareth and Home of the Holy Family (Barcelona 1895). The spiritual autobiography has a literary characterdialoguing with Jesus, Mary and Joseph. The conversations describe a process of Christian and religious perfection inspired in the spirituality of the home and school of Nazareth. His book A Priceless Family Gem (Barcelona 1899) is a guide for marriages and families, which reminds them of the dignity of the sacrament of marriage as a vocation and the important task of the Christian education of their children. The spirit of the Holy Family is a book of meditations dedicated to the members of his religious Institutes, wherein he describes their vocation, identity and mission. There is an edition of his Selected Works (Madrid 1991). A forthcoming edition of his Complete Works will enrich those already published. The first volume is already on the way.Illnesses and Death His many endeavors were not free of difficulties. He also had to endure physical illnesses along his life, but his constancy and fortitude, nourished by his humble obedience to the will of God, helped him persevere. Because of his poor health, due to open sores on his side, which he labelled God's mercies for 16 long years, he passed away on December 17, 1901. He was working at his school, \"Jesús, María y José\" of Barcelona. His last words were his fervent prayer Jesus, Mary and Joseph. His relics are kept in a chapel at the same school where he passed away. He is a spiritual doctor for the youth, children and families. We can draw closer to God by picking up his readings.Witness to Holiness The Process of Canonization was formally introduced in 1956. Once the practice of heroic virtues were recognized in 1982, and the proof of a healing miracle attributed to his intercession was verified, Pope John Paul II declared him blessed in 1984. With another healing miracle through his intercession, he was canonized at Rome on May 16, 2004. Pope John Paul II stated that Josep Manyanet's sanctity stems from the Holy Family. He was called by God, so that \"in his name every family on earth may be blessed.\" The Holy Spirit guided him to proclaim the \"Gospel of the family.\" His inspiration was that \"all families may imitate and bless the Holy Family of Nazareth.\" That is: \"to build a Nazareth in every home,\" and to make of every family a \"Holy Family.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Olympias(Widow († c. 410))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT OLYMPIAS Widow ( c. 410) St. Olympias, a shining light from the Eastern Church, was from a patrician family. She was orphaned at a tender age and brought up by Theodosia, the sister of St. Amphilochius. Olympias emulated Theodosia's virtues, which were a part of her education and treasured memories. Olympias married at a young age, but her husband passed away after 20 days. She modestly declined further marriage proposals. She instead gave her entire life to prayer, good works and charitable giving. Nectarius, the archbishop of Constantinople, made Olympias a deaconess of his church. Her duties included preparing the altar, facilitating Holy Mass and administering the diocese. St. Chrysostom, who succeeded Abp. Nectarius, cooperated with Olympias even though declining to distribute her alms. Olympias was one of the last who remained with him after he went into banishment on June 20, 404. She, too was persecuted, but lived heroically. She crowned a virtuous life by a saintly death around the year 410.</p>"

For it is through the holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her.<br />She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.\"<br />All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:<br />Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall name him Emmanuel, which means \"God is with us.\"<br />When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Giulia Nemesia Valle((1847-1916))</h3><p>Bl. Giulia Nemesia Valle (1847-1916) Bl. Giulia was born at Aosta, Italy, on June 26, 1847. Her parents were Anselmo Valle and Cristina Dalbar. Giulia was baptized in the ancient collegiate church of Saint Orso. She spent the first years of her life in a happy family with her brother Vincent. Their parents together ran a milliner's shop. Giulia was only 4 when her mother passed away. She and Vincent were then entrusted to relatives in Aosta and later to relatives in Donnas. Their schooling, catechism and preparation for the sacraments took place at home under the guidance of a priest who was a family friend. When Giulia turned 11, she was sent to Besançon, Eastern France, to a boarding school run by the Sisters of Charity. Separation from her family caused homesickness, but the experience directed her toward an enduring friendship with Jesus. At Besançon, Giulia became fluent in French, enriched her soul and learned domestic skills. Her simple goodness matured and rendered her loveable and attentive toward others. Five years later, Giulia returned to Donnas, but her house was no longer there. Her father had remarried and moved to Pont Saint Martin. Her brother refused her company and later went away without leaving word. Hence Giulia remained in Donnas discerning God's will for her life. During that period, the Sisters of Charity settled at Pont Saint Martin. In them, Giulia rediscovered her teachers of Besançon, the daughters of Saint Jeanne-Antide Thouret, who helped and encouraged her. She was deeply attracted to their way of life and generously offered herself to God by choosing to become one of them. When her father presented a suitor's offer of a prestigious marriage, Giulia modestly declined. She had given herself completely to Jesus. On the September 8, 1866, Giulia's father accompanied her to the Monastery of Santa Margherita at Vercelli, where the Sisters of Charity run a novitiate. A new, peaceful and joyful life started for Giulia in spite of the separation. It became a matter of building a deeper relationship with God, of knowing herself and the mission of the community and accomplishing God's will. Every day, she discovered what lose or acquire: \"Jesus, strip me of myself, let me be wrapped in you. Jesus, I live for you, and I die for you...\" Upon completing her novitiate, Giulia received a religious habit and a new name: Sr. Nemesia (after an early martyr of the church). She was sent to Tortona, at St. Vincent's Institute. She founded an elementary school, cultural courses, a boarding school and an orphanage. She taught courses at the elementary school and French in the higher classes. Sr. Nemesia also generously gave her time in ministering to the poor. When Sr. Nemesia was nominated as superior of the community at 40, she said its meaning was \"to serve.\" One of her mottos was, \"Keep a quick pace, without looking behind and concentrate on the one goal: God Alone! To Him the glory, to the others joy... Never make others suffer. I shall be very strict with myself and full of charity towards the others. Love, gratuitously offered, is the only thing that remains.\" On the morning of May 10, 1903, Sr. Nemesia wrote to her orphans and boarders, \"I am leaving happily; I entrust you to our Lady... I shall follow you in every moment of the day.\" She had passed away at 4 that morning. In Borgaro, a small country in the vicinity of Turin, there is a small group of young girls waiting to be accompanied along a new path, toward the total self-gift to God and to serve Him in the poor. They are the novices of the new province of the Sisters of Charity. The method of Bl. Giulia Nemesia's formation remains the same: kindness, self-renouncement out of love, patience and the common good.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gatian(Bishop (3rd century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GATIAN Bishop (3rd century) St. Gatian and St. Dionysius of Paris preached at Tours in western France around the middle of the third century. They attracted souls to Jesus, and many received faith in Him. Many communities practicing idolatry were converted. St. Gatian celebrated the Eucharist in grottoes and caves (Didache). The community spread. To escape persecutors, he sometimes hid inside dugouts. St. Joseph's intercession helped St. Gatian lead the church for fifty years. He acted in the person of Jesus Christ as priest, prophet and king (Melchizedek). At the end of his life, he passed away peacefully in the Holy Family's presence.</p>"

I did not ask him where he came from, nor did he tell me his name.<br />But he said to me, 'You will be with child and will bear a son. So take neither wine nor strong drink, and eat nothing unclean.

Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall name him John.<br />And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,<br />for he will be great in the sight of (the) Lord. He will drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will be filled with the holy Spirit even from his mother's womb,<br />and he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.<br />He will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of fathers toward children and the disobedient to the understanding of the righteous, to prepare a people fit for the Lord.\"<br />Then Zechariah said to the angel, \"How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.\"<br />And the angel said to him in reply, \"I am Gabriel, who stand before God. I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.<br />But now you will be speechless and unable to talk until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.\"<br />Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and were amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary.<br />But when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was gesturing to them but remained mute.<br />Then, when his days of ministry were completed, he went home.<br />After this time his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she went into seclusion for five months, saying,<br />So has the Lord done for me at a time when he has seen fit to take away my disgrace before others.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Urban V(Pope (1310-1370))</h3><p>BLESSED URBAN V Pope (1310-1370) Guillame de Grimoard, later Bl. Urban, studied in Montpellier and Toulouse before becoming a Benedictine in Marseilles. After earning a doctorate in law, he was consecrated abbot of St. Germain in Auxerre and St. Victor in Marseilles. Bl. Urban was consecrated pope in 1362. He was the sixth pope to reside in Avignon instead of Rome. The year after his election, he preached a crusade, which was supported by John II of France, but not elsewhere. In 1367, he returned to Rome, but found the city unlivable. Ignoring the pleas of Petrarch and the prophecy of Bridget of Sweden, he returned to Avignon in 1372. He passed away three months after.</p><hr /><h3>St. Nemesion(Martyr († 250))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT NEMESION Martyr( 250) During Decius' persecution, Nemesion, an Egyptian, was accused of theft and arrested at Alexandria. He exposed the perjury, but was later condemned for being Christian. As punishment, he was scourged and afterward burned alive. Standing near the tribunal were four soldiers and a civilian, all Christians. They encouraged one confessor who was being tortured. As a result, all were brought before a judge, sentenced and beheaded. Ater, Heron and Isidore, all Egyptians, with Dioscorus, a 15-year-old, suffered similar tortures. They were arrested at Alexandria and brutally tortured. Their bodies were scourged, their limbs were disjointed and then they were burned alive. In the company of saints, the martyrs behold God and the Holy Virgin forever. \"Whoever loses his life for my sake will save it,\" says the Lord (Matt. 16:25).</p>"

The LORD also reveals to you that he will establish a house for you.<br />And when your time comes and you rest with your ancestors, I will raise up your heir after you, sprung from your loins, and I will make his kingdom firm.<br />I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me. And if he does wrong, I will correct him with the rod of men and with human chastisements;<br />Your house and your kingdom shall endure forever before me; your throne shall stand firm forever.'\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>89(88),2-3.4-5.27.29.</em><p>The favors of the LORD I will sing forever; <br />through all generations my mouth shall proclaim your faithfulness.<br />For you have said, “My kindness is established forever”; <br />in heaven you have confirmed your faithfulness.<br />“I have made a covenant with my chosen one, <br />I have sworn to David my servant:<br />Forever will I confirm your posterity <br />and establish your throne for all generations.”<br />“He shall say of me, 'You are my father, <br />my God, the Rock, my savior.'<br />Forever I will maintain my kindness toward him, <br />and my covenant with him stands firm.”</p><h3>Letter to the Romans</h3><em>16,25-27.</em><p>Now to him who can strengthen you, according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret for long ages<br />but now manifested through the prophetic writings and, according to the command of the eternal God, made known to all nations to bring about the obedience of faith,<br />to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>1,26-38.</em><p>In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,<br />to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.<br />And coming to her, he said, \"Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.\"<br />But she was greatly troubled at what was said and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.<br />Then the angel said to her, \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.<br />Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall name him Jesus.<br />He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,<br />and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.\"<br />But Mary said to the angel, \"How can this be, since I have no relations with a man?\"<br />And the angel said to her in reply, \"The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.<br />And behold, Elizabeth, your relative, has also conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren;<br />for nothing will be impossible for God.\"<br />Mary said, \"Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord. May it be done to me according to your word.\" Then the angel departed from her.</p><hr /><h3>St. Delphinus(Bishop († 403))</h3><p>SAINT DELPHINUS Bishop ( 403) Little is known of St. Delphinus before his elevation to the episcopate. He assisted at the Council of Saragossa in 330, where the Priscillianists were rebuked. He also assisted at the Council of Bordeaux, which condemned the same schismatics. St. Delphinus baptized St. Paulerius in 388. The latter, in several letters, speaks of St. Delphinus as a father and master. St. Delphinus passed away on December 24, 403.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Thrasilla and Emiliana(Virgins (6th century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINTS THRASILLA and EMILIANA Virgins(6th century) Sts. Thrasilla and Emiliana were the aunts of St. Gregory the Great. They lived in their father's house: practicing virtue and the norms of piety. One night, Thrasilla saw a vision of her uncle, St. Felix, a pope. He showed her the seat prepared for her in heaven, saying, \"Come; I will receive you.\" The next day, Thrasilla fell ill with a fever. Soon after, on December 24, she passed away. After a few days, Thrasilla appeared in a vision to her sister Emiliana, inviting her to celebrate the Epiphany in eternal bliss. Emiliana also fell sick, and passed away on January 8. God does not interfere with the freedom of mankind, but makes Himself known according to love and wisdom. Thrasilla and Emiliana loved God more than anything. Such was their conformity to God that they encountered him fully after passing from this life to the next.</p><hr /><h3>Sts. Adam & Eve()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

After Jesus' ascension, Stephen began working to spread what was then called The Way. He preached the teachings of Jesus and participated in the conversion of Jews and Gentiles. Acts tells the story of how Stephen was tried for blasphemy by the Sanhedrin. He was then stoned to death by a mob at the encouragement of Saul of Tarsus, the future Saint Paul. Stephen died while praying for those who killed him: \"Lord, do not hold this sin against them.\" St. Stephen's name is derived from the Greek Stephanos, meaning \"crown.\" In Aramaic, his name translates as Kelil. St. Stephen is traditionally depicted with a crown, three stones and the martyrs' palm. In Eastern Christian iconography, he is shown as a young, beardless man with a tonsure, wearing deacon's vestments and often holding a miniature church building and censer.</p>"

He was called to follow Christ on the banks of the Jordan, in the first days of the Lord's public ministry. He was also chosen to witness the Transfiguration and the Agony in the Garden. During the Last Supper, St. John's head rested on Jesus' bosom; and in the hours of the Passion, when others fled or denied the Lord, St. John kept his place by Jesus' side. At the last, he stood by the Cross with Mary. From the Cross, the dying Savior entrusted his Mother. Every act of Jesus was significant and has infinite value. With his last words, He tells all believers the place Mary should occupy in their hearts. \"'Here is your mother.' From that time on, this disciple took her into his home\" (Jn 19:27). Thus fitly, as St. Austin says, \"to a virgin was the Virgin entrusted.\" After the Ascension, St. John lived in Jerusalemand then at Ephesus. When he was thrown by Domitian into a cauldron of boiling oil, he was miraculously preserved from harm. Afterward, he was banished to the isle of Patmos, where he saw the visions described in the Apocalypse. He is the author of the Fourth Gospel, the Apocalypse and three Epistles. St. John died peacefully at Ephesus around the year 100.</p>"

Thomas became the archdeacon of Canterbury and later the lord high chancellor of England. When Abp. Theobald passed away in 1160, the king insisted on Thomas' consecration. Thomas refused, warning the king that from that hour their friendship would be broken. In the end, he yielded. He was consecrated; and the conflict broke out immediately. After 6 years of contention, partly spent in exile, Abp. Thomas, with full foresight of martyrdom, returned to his Church. On December 29, 1170, as vespers began, four knights broke into his cathedral crying, \"Where is the archbishop?\" Thomas said, \"Here I am.\" The knights then struck him to death. Six months later, Henry II was publicly scourged at the Saint's shrine and restored the Church's rights. St. Thomas' prayers were likely the catalyst; because God is almighty and blessed in His saints (Ps. 116:15).</p>"

This man was righteous and devout, awaiting the consolation of Israel, and the holy Spirit was upon him.<br />It had been revealed to him by the holy Spirit that he should not see death before he had seen the Messiah of the Lord.<br />He came in the Spirit into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,<br />he took him into his arms and blessed God, saying:<br />Now, Master, you may let your servant go in peace, according to your word,<br />for my eyes have seen your salvation,<br />which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,<br />a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and glory for your people Israel.\"<br />The child's father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;<br />and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, \"Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be contradicted<br />(and you yourself a sword will pierce) so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.\"<br />There was also a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage,<br />and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She never left the temple, but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.<br />And coming forward at that very time, she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.<br />When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions of the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.<br />The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favor of God was upon him.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvester I(Pope, (+ 335))</h3><p>SAINT SYLVESTERPope(? - 335) St. Sylvester was born in Rome toward the end of the third century.He was a young priest when Christians were persecuted under Diocletian. On street corners, marketplaces and public fountains, idols were erected to ensnare Christians. The faithful would decline to offer pagan sacrifice. During this time, Fr. Sylvester nourished his flock with the sacraments. Jesus said, \"My flesh is true food\" on several occasions (Jn. 6:53-58). In 312 A.D., Emperor Constantine triumphed under the standard of the Cross. He declared himself the Christians' protector and built churches. At this juncture, Fr. Sylvester was elected to the Chair of Peter: the first pope to lead the Church in security and peace. He used these blessings to renew the Church's discipline and confirm its sacred truths in two great councils. At the Council of Arles, Pope Sylvester condemned the schism of the Donatists. At the Council of Nicæa, the first general council of the Church, he denounced Arianism by declaring Jesus Christ is the true and living God: consubstantial with the Father; with human and divine natures.</p>"
