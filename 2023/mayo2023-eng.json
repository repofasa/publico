Slaughter and eat.'<br />But I said, 'Certainly not, sir, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'<br />But a second time a voice from heaven answered, 'What God has made clean, you are not to call profane.'<br />This happened three times, and then everything was drawn up again into the sky.<br />Just then three men appeared at the house where we were, who had been sent to me from Caesarea.<br />The Spirit told me to accompany them without discriminating. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.<br />He related to us how he had seen (the) angel standing in his house, saying, 'Send someone to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter,<br />who will speak words to you by which you and all your household will be saved.'<br />As I began to speak, the holy Spirit fell upon them as it had upon us at the beginning,<br />and I remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said, 'John baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy Spirit.'<br />If then God gave them the same gift he gave to us when we came to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to be able to hinder God?\"<br />When they heard this, they stopped objecting and glorified God, saying, \"God has then granted life-giving repentance to the Gentiles too.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>42(41),2-3.43(42),3.4.</em><p>As the hind longs for the running waters, <br />so my soul longs for you, O God.<br />Athirst is my soul for God, the living God. <br />When shall I go and behold the face of God?<br />Send forth your light and your fidelity; <br />they shall lead me on <br />And bring me to your holy mountain, <br />to your dwelling place.<br />Then will I go in to the altar of God, <br />the God of my gladness and joy; <br />Then will I give you thanks upon the harp, <br />O God, my God!</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>10,11-18.</em><p>Jesus said: \"I am the good shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.<br />A hired man, who is not a shepherd and whose sheep are not his own, sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away, and the wolf catches and scatters them.<br />This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.<br />I am the good shepherd, and I know mine and mine know me,<br />just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I will lay down my life for the sheep.<br />I have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. These also I must lead, and they will hear my voice, and there will be one flock, one shepherd.<br />This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it up again.<br />No one takes it from me, but I lay it down on my own. I have power to lay it down, and power to take it up again. This command I have received from my Father.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Joseph the Worker()</h3><p>Saint Joseph the WorkerReadings proper for the feast: Gn. 1:26-2:3 or Col. 3:14-24; Mt 13:54-58 Today is a wonderful occasion to reflect on the importance of work in the life of the human person, the family and the community. We are made in the image and likeness of God, we participate with God in the work of maintaining and sanctifying His creation. We work with Jesus; Jesus said “My Father is always at his work to this very day, and I too am working” (Jn. 5:17). Every day, St. Joseph, as a carpenter, provided for the family's needs with manual work. Thus the Church rightly points to him as the patron of workers. The dignity of the human person is constructed through work, and in the light of this truth, we can clearly perceive the fundamental connection between the person, work and society. Human activity - the Second Vatican Council recalls - proceeds from the human person and is ordered to the person. According to God's design and will, it must serve the true good of humanity and allow \"man as an individual and as a member of society to cultivate and carry out his integral vocation\" (cf. Gaudium et spes, n. 35). In order to fulfil this mission, a \"tested spirituality of human work\" must be cultivated that is firmly rooted in the \"Gospel of work\" and believers are called to proclaim and to witness to the Christian meaning of work in their many activities and occupations (cf. Laborem exercens, n. 26). May St. Joseph, such a great and humble saint be an example that inspires Christian workers, who should call on him in every circumstance. Today, I wish to entrust to the provident guardian of the Holy Family of Nazareth the young people who are training for their future profession, the unemployed, and those who are suffering from the hardship of the shortage of employment, families and the whole world of work, with the expectations and challenges, the problems and prospects that characterize it.(Partially taken from John Paul II - General audience, Solemnity of Saint Joseph, Wednesday, 19 March 2003)</p>"

And a large number of people was added to the Lord.<br />Then he went to Tarsus to look for Saul,<br />and when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a large number of people, and it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>87(86),1-3.4-5.6-7.</em><p>His foundation upon the holy mountains,<br />the LORD loves:<br />the gates of Zion, <br />more than any dwelling of Jacob.<br />Glorious things are said of you, <br />O city of God!<br />I tell of Egypt and Babylon <br />among those who know the LORD; <br />of Philistia, Tyre, Ethiopia: <br />\"This man was born there.\"<br />and of Zion they shall say: <br />“One and all were born in her; <br />and he who has established her <br />is the Most High LORD.”<br />They shall note, when the peoples are enrolled: <br />\"This man was born there.\"<br />And all shall sing, in their festive dance: <br />\"My home is within you.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>10,22-30.</em><p>The feast of the Dedication was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter.<br />And Jesus walked about in the temple area on the Portico of Solomon.<br />So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, \"How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.\"<br />Jesus answered them, \"I told you and you do not believe. The works I do in my Father's name testify to me.<br />But you do not believe, because you are not among my sheep.<br />My sheep hear my voice; I know them, and they follow me.<br />I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish. No one can take them out of my hand.<br />My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can take them out of the Father's hand.<br />The Father and I are one.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. José Maria Rubio y Peralta()</h3><p>St. José Maria Rubio y PeraltaPriest (1864 - 1929) St. José Maria was born in Spain in 1864 to a large family of farmers. He entered the seminary when he was twelve in 1876. After his ordination in 1887, Fr. José was both a parish priest and professor at Seminary in Madrid. After a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Fr. José asked his bishop's permission to join the Society of Jesus. He had postponed this dream for many years in order to care for an elderly priest. Fr. José took his first vows as a Jesuit when he was forty-four. He became known as the “Apostle of Madrid.” People came from great distances to celebrate the sacrament of Penance with him, where they encountered the \"Wonderful Counselor ... Prince of Peace\" (Is. 9:6). Fr. José was deeply attached to poor people and preached about causes - rising to the occassion and serving their communities. Many lay people came to Fr. José to ask how they could help. He guided them to open tuition-free schools, clinics, housing for needy families and jobs for the unemployed. Fr. José also provided for the spiritual needs of the poor by making the sacraments more available to them. At the center of the Priest’slife and ministry was his love for Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament. He told the people that prayer must always come first. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1985.</p><hr /><h3>St. Athanasius(Bishop & Doctor of the Church (+ 373))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ATHANASIUS Bishop & Doctor of the Church(+ 373) St. Athanasius was born in Egypt toward the end of the third century. In his youth, he cultivated piety, learning, and deep mastery of sacred writings. Athanasius' faithfulness and diligence befitted one whom God chose to be champion and defender against the Arian heresy. Though only a deacon, Athanasius accompanied his bishop to the Council of Nicæa in 325. His learning and ability saw him defend the Faith in compelling and inspired tongues. A few months later, Athanasius was appointed Patriarch of Alexandria. For forty-six years, he bore - often well-nigh alone - the whole brunt of the Arian assault. When Patr. Athanasius refused to restore Arius, the heretic, to Catholic communion, the emperor ordered Constantinople's Patriarch to do so. Arius took an oath that he always believed the Church's teachings. Patr. Athanasius, after using every effort to move the Emperor, had recourse to fasting and prayer, that God would avert the sacrilege. When the day came for Arius' solemn entrance in the great church of Sancta Sophia, he died on the way, and the sacrilege was averted. Patr. Athanasius stood unmoved against four Roman emperors: although being exiled five times, the victim of perpetual calumny, and living in constant peril of death. Firm and adamant in his defense of the Faith, St. Athanasius was meek and humble, pleasant and winning in conversation, beloved by his flock, unwearied in labors, in prayer, in mortifications, and in zeal for souls. In 373, Athanasius' stormy life closed in peace. He left the Church with the whole and ancient Faith, defended and explained in writings rich in thought and learning, clear, keen, and stately in expression.He is honored as one of the greatest Doctors of the Church.</p>"

But John left them and returned to Jerusalem.<br />They continued on from Perga and reached Antioch in Pisidia. On the sabbath they entered (into) the synagogue and took their seats.<br />After the reading of the law and the prophets, the synagogue officials sent word to them, \"My brothers, if one of you has a word of exhortation for the people, please speak.\"<br />So Paul got up, motioned with his hand, and said, \"Fellow Israelites and you others who are God-fearing, listen.<br />The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and exalted the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt.

After a childhood of singular holiness, he begged to be admitted into the Dominican house at Fiesole; but the Superior, to test his sincerity and perseverance, told him he must first learn by heart the book of the Decretals, containing several hundred pages. This apparently impossible task was accomplished within twelve months; and Antoninus received the coveted habit in his sixteenth year. While still very young, he filled several important posts of his Order, and was consulted on questions of difficulty by the most learned men of his day: being known for his wonderful prudence as \"the Counsellor.\" He wrote several works on theology and history, and sat as Papal Theologian at the Council of Florence. In 1446, he was compelled to accept the archbishopric of that city; and in this dignity earned for himself the title, \"Father of the Poor,\" for all he had was at their disposal. St. Antoninus never refused an alms that was asked in the name of God. When he had no money, he gave his clothes, shoes, or furniture. One day, being sent by the Florentines to the Pope, as he approached Rome, a beggar came up to him almost naked, and asked him for an alms for Christ's sake. Outdoing St. Martin, Antoninus gave him his whole cloak. When he entered the city, another was given him; by whom he knew not. His household consisted of only six persons; his palace contained no plate or costly furniture, and was often nearly destitute of the necessaries of life. His one mule was frequently sold for the relief of the poor, when it would be bought back for him by some wealthy citizen. He passed away embracing the crucifix on May 5, 1459, often repeating the words, \"To serve God is to reign.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Jutta (Judith)()</h3><hr />"

Anna Rosa Gattorno (1831-1900)()</h3><p>BLESSED ANNA ROSA GATTORNO (1831-1900) \"My love, what can I do to make the whole world love you? ... Make use once again of this instrument to renew the faith and the conversion of sinners.\" This generous outburst, uttered at the feet of her 'Supreme Good' who drew her ever closer to Him constituted the deepest yearning of Anna Rosa Gattorno's heart, leading her to offer her life totally in a continuous sacrifice for the glory and pleasure of the Father. Anna Rosa was born in Genoa on October 14, 1831, to a deeply Christian, well-to-do family of good name. She was baptized the same day in the parish of S. Donato and received the names Rosa, Maria, Benedetta.In her father, Francesco, and her mother, Adelaide Campanella, like their other five children, Anna Rosa found the first models for her moral and Christian life. When she was twelve years old, she was confirmed at S. Maria delle Vigne by Cardinal Archbishop Tadini. As a young girl, she was educated at home, as was the custom in rich families at that time. With her serene and loveable character, open to piety and charity, she was nonetheless firm and knew how to react to the confrontations of the political and anticlerical climate of the time, which did not spare even some members of the Gattorno family. At the age of twenty-one, Rosa married her cousin Gerolamo Custo (November 5, 1852), and moved to Marseilles. Unforeseen financial difficulties very soon upset the happiness of the new family, which was forced to return to Genoa in a state of poverty. More serious misfortunes were looming: their first child, Carlotta, after a sudden illness was left deaf and dumb for life; Gerolamo's attempt to find fortune abroad ended with his return, aggravated by a fatal illness. The happiness of the other two children was deeply disturbed by her husband's disappearance, which left her a widow less than six years after their marriage (March 9, 1858). A few months later, she lost her youngest little son. The succession of so many sad events in her life marked a radical change, which she called her \"conversion\" to the total gift of herself to the Lord, to his love and to love of neighbor. Purified by her trials and strengthened in spirit, she understood the true meaning of pain and was confirmed in the certainty of her new vocation. Under the guidance of her confessor, Fr. Giuseppe Firpo, she made private perpetual vows of chastity and obedience on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception in 1858, followed by vows of poverty (1861) in the spirit of St. Francis of Assisi, as a Franciscan tertiary. Since 1855, she had also obtained the benefit of daily communion, which was uncommon in those days. She remained constantly anchored to this source of grace and, encouraged by ever growing intimacy with the Lord, she found support, missionary fervor, strength and zeal in service to her brothers and sisters.In 1862, she received the gift of hidden stigmata, perceived most intensely on Fridays. As a faithful wife and exemplary mother, never depriving her children of anything - always following and loving them tenderly - with greater availability, she learned to share in the sufferings of others, giving herself in apostolic charity: \"I dedicated myself with greater zeal to pious works and to visiting hospitals and the poor sick at home, helping them by meeting their needs as much as I could and serving them in all things.\" The Catholic associations in Genoa competed for her, so that although she loved silence and concealment, her genuinely evangelizing way of life was remarked by all.Progressing on this path, she was made president of the \"Pious Union of the New Ursulines Daughters of Holy Mary Immaculate,\" founded by Frassinetti, and was entrusted with the revision of the Rule, at the express wish of Archbishop Charvaz.On that precise occasion (February 1864), redoubling her prayers to Christ Crucified, she received the inspiration for a new Rule, her own specific Foundation. Fearful of being forced to abandon her children, she prayed, made acts of penance and asked for advice. Fra. Francis of Camporosso, a lay Capuchin, who is a saint, to whom she also expressed her apprehension before the serious troubles that were imminent, supported and encouraged her, as did her confessor and the Archbishop of Genoa.However, feeling her maternal duties more and more acutely, she sought authoritative confirmation in the words of Pius IX, with the secret hope of being relieved. The Pontiff, at an audience on January 3, 1866, instead enjoined her to start her foundation immediately, adding: \"This Institute will spread in all the parts of the world as swiftly as the flight of the dove. God will take care of your children: you must think of God and his work.\" She therefore accepted to do the Lord's will; and as she then wrote in her Memoirs: \"I generously offered them to God and repeated to him Abraham's words: 'Here I am, ready to do your divine will'.... Having offered myself for his Work, I received immense consolations...\" Overcoming the resistance of her relatives and, to the disappointment of her Bishop, leaving the associations in Genoa, she founded her new religious family in Piacenza, and named it definitively, \"Daughters of St. Anne, mother of Mary Immaculate\" (December 8, 1866). She was clothed on July 26, 1867, and on April 8, 1870, made her religious profession, together with twelve sisters. Fr. Tornatore, a priest of the Congregation of the Mission, collaborated with her in the Institute's development. Expressly requested, he wrote the Rule and was then considered Co-Founder of the Institute. Entrusting herself totally to divine Providence and motivated from the start by a courageous charitable impulse, Rosa Gattorno began with a spirit of motherly dedication to consolidate God's Work, as the Pope had called it, and as she too, chosen to cooperate in it, would always call it. They attentively cared for any form of suffering and moral or material poverty, with the one intention of serving Jesus in his painful and injured members and of \"evangelising first and foremost with life.\" Various works came into being for the poor and the sick with any form of illness, for lonely, elderly or abandoned persons, the little and the defenceless, adolescents, and young girls \"at risk\" for whom she arranged appropriate instruction and subsequent integration in the working world. In addition, she soon opened schools for the people and for the education of the children of the poor, and other works of human and evangelical advancement in accordance with the greatest needs of the time and with an effective presence in ecclesial and civil life. \"Servants of the poor and ministers of mercy\" she called her daughters, and she urged them to accept, as a sign of the Lord's favor, to serve their brethren with love and humility: \"Be humble ... only think that you are the least of the Church's servants ... and have the grace to belong to her.\" Less than ten years after its foundation, the Institute obtained the Decree of Praise (1876), and its definitive approval in 1879. For the Rule, it had to wait until 1892.Highly esteemed and appreciated by all, she also worked in Piacenza with Bishop Scalabrini, who has now been beatified, and in particular in the institute for deaf-mutes, which he founded. However Mother Rosa Gattorno was not spared humiliations, difficulties and tribulations of all kinds. Despite this, the Institute spread rapidly, in Italy and abroad, thus achieving the Foundress' ardent missionary desire: \"Oh my Love! How I feel myself burning with the desire to make you known and loved by all! I would like to attract all the world, to give to all, to appease all ... I would like to go everywhere and shout out for everybody to come and love you.\" To be \"Jesus' voice\" and to bring all people the message of the love that saves was and always remained her heart's deepest desire. In 1878, she was already sending the first Daughters of St. Anne to Bolivia, then to Brazil, Chile, Peru, Eritrea, France and Spain. In Rome, where her work began in 1873, she organised boys' and girls' schools for the poor, nursery schools, assistance for the new-born babies of workers in the tobacco factory, houses for former prostitutes, serving women, nurses for home care, etc. There she also had the Generalate built, with its adjacent church. In all, at her passing from this life, there were 368 houses in which 3,500 sisters were carrying out their mission. The secret of her journey of holiness, of the dynamism of her charity and of the strength of mind with which she could face all obstacles with firm faith and guide the Institute with full dedication, courage and far-sightedness for thirty-four years, was her continuous union with God and total, trusting abandonment in Him: \"Although I am in the midst of such a torrent of things to do, I am never without the union with my Good.\" Her attention and docility to the impulses of the Spirit, her deep and loving participation in Christ's Passion, her ceaseless prayers for the conversion of sinners and the sanctification of all mankind. She had a deep sense of belonging to Church and was ever humble, devout and obedient to the directives of the Pope and the hierarchy.With her fondness of St. Anne, she had a special love for Mary, to whom she entirely entrusted herself, in order to belong totally to God and totally to her brethren.A pure and simple instrument in the hands of the \"superfine Craftsman,\" conformed to the Poor Christ and with him, a victim of love, she fulfilled in her life the desire she inculcated in her daughters: \"To live for God, to die for Him and to spend life for love.\" She lived like this until February 1900, when she caught a dangerous form of influenza and rapidly deteriorated: her health, sorely tried by her acts of penance, frequent exhausting journeys and an enormous mass of correspondence, worries and serious disappointments, no longer resisted. On 4 May, she received the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick, and two days later, on 6 May, at 9.00 a.m., having ended her earthly pilgrimage, she died a holy death in the Generalate.The fame of holiness which had surrounded her during her life spread after her death and grew unimpeded all over the world. As an expression of a rare plan of God, in her three-fold experience of wife and mother, widow and then religious and Foundress, in her mission of service to humanity and to extending the kingdom, Rosa Gattorno brought great honour to the \"feminine genius.\" Although she was ever faithful to God's call and a genuine teacher of Christian and ecclesial life, she remained essentially a mother: of her own children, whom she constantly followed, of the Sisters, whom she deeply loved, and of all the needy, the suffering and the unhappy, in whose faces she contemplated the face of Christ, poor, wounded and crucified. Her charism has spread in the Church with the birth of other forms of evangelical life: Sisters of Contemplative Life; a Religious Association of Priests; the Secular Institute and the Ecclesial Movement for the Laity, which are active in the Church in almost all the parts of the world.She was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on April 9, 2000 at Rome.</p><hr /><h3>St. Petronax()</h3><hr />"

Her father, Goffredo, originally from Castelleone di Suasa (Ancona), after having completed his doctorate in medicine at Rome, moved to Viterbo where he practiced the medical profession brilliantly in the Grand Hospital. From his marriage to Marzia Zampichetti, of an ancient family of Viterbo, four children were born: Domenico, Maria Maddalena, Rosa and Orazio. Rosa was naturally gifted with intelligence and an uncommon human sensibility. The education that she received in her family allowed her to develop her many talents of mind and heart, forming her in steadfast Christian principles. According to her first biographer, Father Girolamo Andreucci, S.I., she made a vow to consecrate her life to God at the age of seven. During the early years of her youth, she lived through a conflict between the attractions of the world and the promise made to God. Rosa overcame this crisis with trusting prayer and mortification. At age twenty, Rosa raised questions about her own future. The women of her time could choose only two orientations for their live: marriage or the cloister. Rosa esteemed both, but she felt called to realize another project for the good of the Church and the society of her time. Urged on by prophetic interior occurrences, she committed much time in suffering and searching before reaching a resolution that was completely innovative. In the autumn of 1676, on the advice of her father, Rosa entered the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine, with the prospect of fulfilling her vow. With her Aunt Anna Cecilia beside her, she learned to listen to God in silence and in meditation. She remained in the monastery for only a few months because the sudden death of her father forced her to return to her suffering mother. In the years immediately following, Rosa had to bear the burden of serious events for her family: her brother Domenico died at only twenty-seven years of age; a few months later her mother died, unable to bear the sorrow. In the meantime, Maria Maddalena married. There remained at home only Orazio and Rosa, by now twenty-four years old. Challenged by the desire to do something great for God, in May of 1684, the Saint began to gather the girls and women of the area in her own home to recite the rosary. The way in which the girls and women prayed, and above all, their conversation before and after the prayer, opened the mind and heart of Rosa to a sad reality: the woman of the common people was a slave of cultural, moral and spiritual poverty. She then understood that the Lord was calling her to a higher mission which she gradually identified in the urgent need to dedicate herself to the instruction and Christian formation of young women, not with sporadic encounters, but with a school understood in the real and true sense of the word. On August 30, 1685, with the approval of the Bishop of Viterbo, Cardinal Urbano Sacchetti and the collaboration of two friends, Gerolama Coluzzelli and Porzia Bacci, Rosa left her father's home to begin her first school, according to an innovative plan that had matured in prayer and her search for the will of God. The first objective of the Foundress was to give the girls of the common people a complete Christian formation and prepare them for life in society. Without great pretense, Rosa opened the first \"Public School for Girls in Italy\". The origins were humble but the significance was prophetic: the human promotion and spiritual uplifting of woman was a reality that did not take long to receive the recognition of the religious and civil authorities.Expansion of the Work The initial stages were not easy. The three Maestre (teachers) had to face the resistance of clergy who considered the teaching of the catechism as their private office. But the harshest suspicion came from conformists who were scandalized by the boldness of this woman of the upper middle class of Viterbo who had taken to heart the education of ignorant girls. Rosa faced everything for the love of God and with her characteristic strength, continuing on the path that she had undertaken, by now sure that she was truly following the plan of God. The fruits proved her to be right. The same pastors recognized the moral improvement that the work of education generated among the girls and mothers. The validity of this initiative was acknowledged and its fame went beyond the confines of the Diocese. Cardinal Mark Antonio Barbarigo, Bishop of Montefiascone, understood the genius of the Viterbo project and he called the Saint to his diocese. The Foundress, always ready to sacrifice herself for the glory of God, responded to the invitation. From 1692 to 1694, she opened ten schools in Montefiascone and the villages surrounding Lake Bolsena. The cardinal provided the material means and Rosa made the families aware, trained the teachers, and organized the schools. When she had to return to Viterbo to attend to the strengthening of her first school, Rosa entrusted the schools and the teachers to the direction of a young woman, St. Lucia Filippini, in whom she has seen particular gifts of mind, heart and spirit. After the openings in Viterbo and Montefiascone, other schools were started in Lazio. Rosa reached Rome in 1706, but the first experience in Rome was a real failure which marked her deeply and caused her to wait six long years before regaining the trust of the authorities. On December 8, 1713, with the help of Abate Degli Atti, a great friend of the Venerini family, Rosa was able to open one of her schools in the center of Rome at the foot of the Campidoglio. On October 24, 1716, they received a visit from Pope Clement XI, accompanied by eight Cardinals, who wanted to attend the lessons. Amazed and pleased, at the end of the morning he addressed these words to the Foundress: \"Signora Rosa, you are doing that which we cannot do. We thank you very much because with these schools you will sanctify Rome \". From that moment on, Governors and Cardinals asked for schools for their areas. The duties of the Foundress became intense, consisting of travels and hard work interwoven with joys and sacrifices for the formation of new communities. Wherever a new school sprang up, in a short time a moral improvement could be noted in the youth. Rosa Venerini died a saintly death in the community of St. Mark's in Rome on the evening of May 7, 1728. She had opened more than forty schools. Her remains were entombed in the nearby Church of the Gesù, so loved by her. In 1952, on the occasion of her Beatification, they were transferred to the chapel of the Generalate in Rome. She was canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 15, 2006 at Rome.Her Spirituality During her entire life, Rosa moved in the ocean of the Will of God. She said, \"I feel so nailed to the Will of God that nothing else matters, neither death nor life. I want what He wants; I want to serve Him as much as pleases Him and no more\". After her first contacts with the Dominican Fathers at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Oak Tree, near Viterbo, she definitely followed the austere and balanced spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola under the direction of the Jesuits, especially Father Ignatius Martinelli. The crises of adolescence, the perplexity of youth, the search for a new way, the institution of the schools and the communities, the rapport with the Church and the world-all were oriented to the Divine Will. Prayer was the breath of her day. Rosa did not impose on herself or her Daughters long vocal prayers, but recommended that the life of the Maestre, in the practice of the precious education ministry, be a continuous speaking with God, of God and for God. Intimate communion with the Lord was nourished by mental prayer, which the Saint considered \"essential nourishment of the soul\". In meditation, Rosa listened to the Teacher who taught along the roads of Palestine and in a particular way from the height of the Cross. With her gaze upon the crucifix, Rosa always felt more strongly her passion for the salvation of souls. For this reason, she celebrated and lived daily the Eucharist in a mystical way. In her imagination, the Saint saw the world as a great circle; she placed herself in the center of it and contemplated Jesus, the immaculate victim, who offered Himself from every part of the world to the Father through the Eucharistic Sacrifice. She called this means of elevating herself to God \"The Greatest Circle\". With incessant prayer, she participated spiritually in all the Masses being celebrated in every part of the world. She united with love the sufferings, hard work and joys of her own life to the sufferings of Jesus Christ, concerned that His Precious Blood would not be shed in vain.The Charism We can summarize the charism of Rosa Venerini in a few words. She lived consumed by two great passions: passion for God and passion for the salvation of souls. When she understood that the girls and women of her time needed to be educated and instructed in the truths of the faith and of morality, she spared nothing of time, hard work, struggle, and difficulties of every kind, as long as it responded to the call of God. She knew that the proclamation of the Good News could be received if people were first liberated from the darkness of ignorance and error. Moreover, she intuited that professional training could give woman a human promotion and affirmation in society. This project required an educating Community and Rosa, without pretense and well before its time in history, offered to the Church the model of the Apostolic Religious Community. Rosa did not practice her educational mission only in the school but took every occasion to announce the love of God. She comforted and cured the sick, raised the spirits of the discouraged, consoled the afflicted, called sinners back to a new life, exhorted to fidelity consecrated souls not observing their call, helped the poor and freed people from every form of moral slavery. \"Educate to save\" became the motto that urged the Maestre Pie Venerini to continue the Work of the Lord intended by their Foundress and radiate the charism of Rosa to the world: to free from ignorance and evil so that the project of God which every person carries within can be visible. This is the magnificent inheritance that Rosa Venerini left her Daughters. Wherever the Maestre Pie Venerini strive to live and transmit the apostolic concern of their Mother, in Italy as in other lands, they give preference to the poor. After having made its contribution to the Italian immigrants to the USA from 1909 and in Switzerland from 1971 to 1985, the Congregation extended its apostolic activity to other lands: India, Brazil, Cameroon, Romania, Albania, Chile, Venezuela and Nigeria.</p><hr /><h3>St. John of Beverley()</h3><hr />"

Teresa Demjanovich()</h3><p>Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, S.C.(March 26, 1901–May 8, 1927) Sr. Miriam Teresa was an American Ruthenian Catholic Sister of Charity who has been beatified by the Catholic Church. The ceremony for this was the first to take place in the United States. She was born Teresa Demjanovich in Bayonne, New Jersey, on March 26, 1901, the youngest of seven children, of Alexander Demjanovich and Johanna Suchy), Ruthenian immigrants to the United States from what is now eastern Slovakia. She received Baptism, Confirmation, and her First Holy Communion in the Byzantine Ruthenian rite of her parents. Teresa felt called to the religious life from a very young age. She delayed her entrance to care for her mother who fell ill. Her family encouraged her to pursue a college education: She attended the College of St. Elizabeth and graduated with highest honors in 1923. She pursued her desire to enter the discalced Carmel, but was discouraged by superiors because of health concerns. She then considered a teaching order; and for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, she made a novena. At the novena's conclusion on December 8, Teresa decided she was called to enter the Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth. She never received an official transfer of rite, and therefore remained a Byzantine Rite Catholic while serving as a Religious Sister in a Roman Rite congregation. As a postulant and novice, Demjanovich taught at the Academy of St. Elizabeth in Convent Station during 1925-1926. In June 1926, her spiritual director, Father Benedict Bradley, O.S.B., asked her to write the conferences for the novitiate. She wrote twenty-six conferences that were published in a book after her passing.Greater Perfection. In November 1926, Demjanovich became ill. After a tonsillectomy, she returned to the convent, but was soon diagnosed with myocarditis and acute appendicitis. Doctors did not think she was strong enough for an operation and her condition worsened. Demjanovich's profession of permanent religious vows was made \"in articulo mortis\" (danger of death) on April 2, 1927. She was operated on for appendicitis on May 6, 1927, and passed away on May 8, 1927. Favors and cures attributed to Teresa's intercession are continually being reported. On December 17, 2013, Pope Francis approved the attribution of a miraculous healing to the intercession of Demjanovich, opening the way to her beatification. Demjanovich was beatified at a ceremony on October 4, 2014, held at the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart in Newark.</p><hr /><h3>St. Victor()</h3><hr />"

Jozef (\"Jef\") began his novitiate with the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary (\"Picpus Fathers\") at the beginning of 1859 and took the name Damien. He would pray every day before a picture of St. Francis Xavier, patron of missionaries, to be sent on a mission. In 1863, his brother, who was to leave for a mission in the Hawaiian Islands, fell ill. Since preparations for the voyage had already been made, Damien obtained permission from the Superior General to take his brother's place. He landed in Honolulu on March 19, 1864. He was ordained to the priesthood on the following May 21. At that time, the Hawaiian Government decided on the harsh measure of quarantine aimed at preventing the spread of leprosy: the deportation to the neighboring Island of Molokai of all those infected by what was then thought to be an incurable disease. The entire mission was concerned about the abandoned lepers, and Bishop Louis Maigret, a Picpus father, felt sure they needed priests. He did not want to send anyone \"in the name of obedience\" because he was aware such an assignment was a potential death sentence. Of the four brothers who volunteered, Damien was the first to leave on May 10, 1873, for Kalaupapa. At his own request and that of the lepers, Damien remained on Molokai. Having contracted leprosy after serving for sixteen years, he passed away on April 15, 1889, at the age of forty-nine. He was buried in the local cemetery under the same Pandanus tree where he had first slept upon his arrival in Molokai. His remains were exhumed in 1936 at the request of the Belgian Government and translated to a crypt of the Church of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts at Louvain. Damien was a Catholic missionary who respected the religious convictions of others. He accepted them as people and joyfully received their collaboration and help. With a heart wide open to the most forsaken, he dignified his office and acted in place of the Good Shepherd. Among his best friends were Meyer, a Lutheran, the superintendent of the leper colony, Clifford, an Anglican, Moritz, a painter and free-thinker who was the doctor on Molokai, and Dr. Masanao Goto, a Japanese Buddhist and leprologist. In his parish ministry or in his works of charity, he found a place for everyone. Though his prayers and intercession, St. Damien continues inspiring believers and non-believers. Many who imitate him discover the source of his heroism.Pope John Paul II beatified Damien de Veuster in Brussels on June 4, 1995; and Pope Benedict XVI canonized him on October 11, 2009, in Rome.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Ivan Merz (1896-1928)()</h3><hr /><p>BLESSED IVAN MERZ (1896-1928) Ivan Merz was born in Banja Luka, Bosnia, on December 16, 1896, and was baptized on February 2, 1897. After attending elementary and middle school in Banja Luka, he was educated at the military academy of Wiener Noustadt. In 1915, he enrolled at the University of Vienna with the dream of teaching young people in Bosnia. He would be following the example of his professor, Ljubomir Marakovic, who helped Ivan to discover the richness of the Catholic faith. In March 1916, Ivan was enlisted in the army and shipped to the Italian battle front, where he spent the greater part of two years beginning in 1917. The war experience and its horrors marked a turning point in Ivan's young life and contributed greatly to his spiritual growth, prompting him to abandon his future into God's hands and to strive with all his might towards the goal of Christian perfection. On February 5, 1918, he wrote in his diary: \"Never forget God! Always desire to be united with Him. Begin each day in the first place with meditation and prayer, possibly close to the Blessed Sacrament or during Mass. During this time, plans for the day are made, one's defects are put under examination and grace is implored for the strength to overcome all weakness. It would be something terrible if this war had no meaning for me!... I must begin a life regenerated in the spirit of this new understanding of Catholicism. The Lord alone can help me, as man can do nothing on his own.\" At this time, Ivan also made a private vow of perpetual chastity. After the war, he continued his studies at Vienna (1919-20), and then in Paris (1920-22). In 1923, he obtained a degree in philosophy. His thesis was entitled, \"The Influence of the Liturgy on the French Authors.\" He then became a professor of language and French literature and was exemplary in his dedication to the students and to his responsibilities as a teacher. In his spare time, he studied philosophy and theology and deepened his knowledge of the documents of the Magisterium of the Church. Ivan was especially noted for his interest in young people and concern for their growth in faith and holiness. He guided them to Christ with writings and organized gatherings. He started the League of Young Croatian Catholics and the Croatian League of Eagles within the country's Catholic Action Movement. Their motto was: \"Sacrifice, Eucharist, Apostolate.\"By his knowledge, example, and using the natural light of reason, he taught others to love and emulate the Vicar of Christ. He also promoted liturgical renewal in Croatia. In the face of any misunderstandings and difficulties, Ivan always had an admirable patience and calm, the fruit of his continual union with God in prayer. Those who knew him well described him as a person who had his \"mind and heart immersed in the supernatural.\" Convinced that the most effective way to save souls was through the Cross of Jesus Christ, he offered to God all his physical and moral sufferings, particularly for the intention of the success of his apostolic endeavors. Shortly before his death, he offered his life for the youth of Croatia. In short, the young man believed that his vocation was very simply \"the Catholic faith.\"Ivan Merz passed away on May 10, 1928 in Zagreb; and was beatified by Pope John Paul II at Banja Luka on June 22, 2003.</p><hr /><h3>St. Comgall()</h3><hr /><p></p>"

Thus says the Lord who accomplishes these things,<br />known from of old.'<br />It is my judgment, therefore, that we ought to stop troubling the Gentiles who turn to God,<br />but tell them by letter to avoid pollution from idols, unlawful marriage, the meat of strangled animals, and blood.<br />For Moses, for generations now, has had those who proclaim him in every town, as he has been read in the synagogues every sabbath.\"</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>96(95),1-2a.2b-3.10.</em><p>Sing to the LORD a new song; <br />sing to the LORD, all you lands.<br />Sing to the LORD; bless his name.<br />Announce his salvation, day after day.<br />Tell his glory among the nations;<br />among all peoples, his wondrous deeds.  <br />Say among the nations: The LORD is king. <br />He has made the world firm, not to be moved; <br />he governs the peoples with equity.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>15,9-11.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"As the Father loves me, so I also love you.

He instituted the fasts and supplications called the Rogations. Almighty God, to dispel lukewarmness and awaken people from spiritual lethargy, made His presence known during the wars and other public calamities. The Holy One made Himself known during earthquakes, fires and when ravenous wild beasts (similar to skinwalkers) roamed the market-places. Amid these scourges, Abp. Mammertus received a token of the divine mercy. A terrible fire happened in the city of Vienne, which baffled the efforts of men, but the Bishop's prayers caused the fire to be extinguished immediately. This miracle strongly affected the minds of the people. The holy prelate took this opportunity to make them sensible of the necessity and efficacy of prayer. He instituted an annual fast and supplication of three days, which all the faithful joined. With sincere compunction of heart, the Church continues assuaging the suffering of Jesus with fasting, prayers and the confession of sins. The Church of Auvergne, where St. Sidonius was the bishop, adopted the pious institution before the year 475; and it became a universal practice in a very short time. Abp. Mammertus passed away about the year 477. He encountered Jesus at the moment of death: receiving the beatific vision and seeing God face to face..</p><hr /><h3>St. Francis di Girolamo()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Carthusian Martyrs()</h3><hr />"

In his youth, he studied Holy Scripture, embraced a monastic life and practiced prayer and asceticism in the deserts of Egypt. He returned to Palestine around 333 and built a monastery near the place of his birth. A spiritual director of countless others, Epiphanius took the great St. Hilarion as his director in spiritual life. Their work in monasteries and apostolate was from 333 to 356. Whenever people said that Epiphanius worked too hard, he would reply, \"God gives the kingdom of heaven if we labor, but no amount of work bears proportion to the reward that awaits us.\" Through the norms of piety, mortification, prayer and penance, Epiphanius received Jesus with the spirit and fervor of the saints. Epiphanius was renowned for his sanctity and for serving the Church. Around 367, he was consecrated Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus. Still wearing the monastic habit and occasionally visiting his monastery in Palestine, Epiphanius was indefatigable in serving the poor and the marginalized. He relaxed his personal austerities when welcoming guests - putting charity ahead of abstinence. During the persecution of the Arian Emperor Valens, Epiphanius was spared thanks to his record of service. In 376, Epiphanius undertook a journey to Antioch in the hope of converting Vitalis, the Apollinarist bishop. In 382, he accompanied St. Paulinus from Antioch to Rome and lodged at the house of St. Paula. Epiphanius returned the favor in 385 when St. Paula visited Cyprus and he provided accommodations for ten days. Epiphanius went to his eternal reward in 403 during a voyage to Salamis. He had served as bishop for thirty-six years.</p><hr /><h3>St. Pancras()</h3><hr /><hr /><h3>Sts. Nereus & Achilleus()</h3><hr />"

Julian of Norwich()</h3><p>Julian of NorwichAnchorite (ca 1342 - 1420) It was popular the 14th century for a number of English men and women to withdraw from the world as hermits. They were known as anchorites. Their hermitage was a small room attached to a local church. Each room had two windows. One through the church wall permitting the anchorite to receive communion. Through the second window, the anchorite received food brought to him or her by village people. Thus they at all times had the window of their heart open to Christ and open to the world. As a young woman, Julian, who was born circa 1342, became an anchorite at the Church of St. Edmund and St. Julian in Norwich. When she was thirty, Julian suffered from a severe illness. While apparently on her deathbed, Julian had a series of intense visions of Jesus Christ, which ended by the time she recovered from her illness on May 13, 1373. Julian wrote about her visions immediately after they had happened (although the text may not have been finished for some years), entitled Revelations of Divine Love. It is believed to be the earliest surviving book written in the English language by a woman. Twenty to thirty years later, perhaps in the early 1390s, Julian began to write a theological exploration of the meaning of the visions, known as The Long Text. This work seems to have gone through many revisions before it was finished, perhaps in the first or even second decade of the fifteenth century.Until her passing around 1420 at the age of seventy-eight, Julian stayed in her simple room. Like most anchorites, she prayed, fasted, did penance, studied, sewed clothing for the poor and advised the village people. In Revelations of Divine Love, Julian described her sixteen visions of Jesus. As she wrote this book about God’s great compassion for us, Julian developed a special vocabulary. She called the Creator our mother and our father. She called Jesus the Redeemer our brother. Revelations is a celebrated work in Catholicism and Anglicanism because of the clarity and depth of Julian's visions of God. Julian of Norwich is now recognised as one of England's most important mystics. Julian of Norwich lived in a time of turmoil, but her theology was optimistic and spoke of God's love in terms of joy and compassion, as opposed to law and duty. For Julian, suffering was not a punishment that God inflicted, as was the common understanding. She believed that God loved everyone and wanted to save them all. Popular theology, magnified by catastrophic contemporary events such as the Black Death and a series of peasant revolts, asserted that God punished the wicked. Julian suggested a more merciful theology, she believed that behind the reality of hell is a greater mystery of God's love. In modern times, she has been classified as a proto-universalist, although she did not claim more than hope that all might be saved. At the time of Julian’s death, people from all over Europe traveled to her room or cell to ask her advice. Everyone recognized that she was close to God. The Church never formally declared her a saint, but through the ages, people have called her “Blessed.” Julian of Norwich is quoted saying,“If there is anywhere on earth a lover of God is always kept safe, I know nothing of it, for it was not shown to me. But this was shown: that in falling and rising again we are always kept in that same precious love.”</p><hr /><h3>St. John the Silent(Bishop (454 - c. 558))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT JOHN THE SILENT Bishop (454 - c. 558) St. John was born in 454 to a patrician family in Nicopolis, Armenia. He received faith from through the teaching, prayers and example of his parents. After their passing, John built a church in honor of the Blessed Virgin, and also a monastery with the help of ten fervent companions; all at the age of eighteen. To protect against egotism and pray by listening, John seldom spoke. When obliged to, he spoke in few words and with discretion. When he was only twenty-eight, the Archbishop of Sebaste obliged John to quit his retreat and consecrated him as bishop of Colonia, Armenia, in 482. In this dignity, John preserved his spirit of recollection and continued his monastic austerities and exercises. While watching one night in prayer, Bp. John saw before him a bright cross, and heard a voice say to him, \"If you desire to be saved, follow this light.\" The seemed to move before him, and at length pointed out to the monastery of St. Sabas. After the vision, Bp. John abdicated the episcopal office and retired to the neighboring monastery of St. Sabas, which at that time contained one hundred and fifty monks. John was then thirty-eight years old. After living there for some years, fetching water, carrying stones and doing other menial work, St. Sabas, judging Fra. John worthy to be elevated to the priesthood, presented him to the Patriarch Elias. John took the patriarch aside, obtained from him a promise of secrecy and said, \"Father, I am an ordained bishop, but have fled on account of the multitude of my sins; and am in this desert to await the visit of the Lord.\" God revealed to St. Sabas the state of the affair, whereupon he summoned John and complained of the latter's unkindness in concealing the matter. Finding himself discovered, John wished to quit the monastery, nor could St. Sabas prevail on him to stay. In the year 503, John withdrew into a neighboring wilderness, but in 510 went back to the monastery, and confined himself for forty years to his cell. Fra. John, by his example and counsels, conducted many fervent souls to God, and continued to emulate, as much as his nature allowed, the employment of the heavenly spirits in uninterrupted exercises of love and praise. Soon after the year 558, he passed from this world and joined the Church Triumphant in heaven. He lived in the desert for seventy-six years, with the exception of nine spent in the episcopal dignity.</p>"

He served as a diplomat for several years, including those of World War I. In 1923, he was ordained to the priesthood. Returning to Romania when World War II broke out, he stayed to serve the Church despite the danger of Allied bombing. When the communists seized power in Romania, he again chose to remain. In 1952, Fr. Vladimir was arrested and charged with high treason for his loyalty to Rome rather than the schismatic church that the communist government was working to establish. After years of maltreatment, he died in prison on May 16, 1954. Fr. Vladimir was beatified on August 31, 2013, by Pope Francis.

Rather it is he who gives to everyone life and breath and everything.<br />He made from one the whole human race to dwell on the entire surface of the earth, and he fixed the ordered seasons and the boundaries of their regions,<br />so that people might seek God, even perhaps grope for him and find him, though indeed he is not far from any one of us.<br />For 'In him we live and move and have our being,' as even some of your poets have said, 'For we too are his offspring.'<br />Since therefore we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the divinity is like an image fashioned from gold, silver, or stone by human art and imagination.<br />God has overlooked the times of ignorance, but now he demands that all people everywhere repent<br />because he has established a day on which he will 'judge the world with justice' through a man he has appointed, and he has provided confirmation for all by raising him from the dead.\"<br />When they heard about resurrection of the dead, some began to scoff, but others said, \"We should like to hear you on this some other time.\"<br />And so Paul left them.<br />But some did join him, and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the Court of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.<br />After this he left Athens and went to Corinth.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>148(147),1-2.11-12ab.12c-14a.14bcd.</em><p>Praise the LORD from the heavens; <br />praise him in the heights;<br />praise him, all you his angels; <br />praise him, all you his hosts.<br />Let the kings of the earth and all peoples,<br />the princes and all the judges of the earth,<br />young men too, and maidens,<br />old men and boys.<br />Praise the name of the LORD, <br />for his name alone is exalted; <br />his majesty is above earth and heaven.<br />He has lifted up the horn of his people.<br />be this his praise from all his faithful ones,<br />from the children of Israel, the people close to him.<br />Alleluia.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>16,12-15.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"I have much more to tell you, but you cannot bear it now.<br />But when he comes, the Spirit of truth, he will guide you to all truth. He will not speak on his own, but he will speak what he hears, and will declare to you the things that are coming.<br />He will glorify me, because he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.<br />Everything that the Father has is mine; for this reason I told you that he will take from what is mine and declare it to you.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Joachina de Vedruna de Mas()</h3><p>Saint Joachina de Vedruna (16 April 1783 – 28 August 1854) St. Joachina was a Catalonian nun who founded the Carmelite Sisters of the Charity. She was born into a virtuous patrician family of deep faith. As a young girl, Joachina believed she wanted to be a nun. However, she married Theodore de Mas, a man from a royal family in Barcelona, Spain, in 1799, when she was only sixteen years old. They had nine children before Theodore was killed when Napoleon invaded Spain. After her husband's passing in 1816, Joachina moved with her children to their estate in Vic. Here, she began her charitable activities with the sick and with young women. Her spiritual director, the Capuchin Esteban de Olot, suggested she establish an apostolic congregation devoted to education and charity. The Order cared for the sick, the poor and anyone in need of an education. They built houses for the homeless and started schools in poor areas. The bishop of Vic, Pablo Jesús Corcuera, told her the institute should be of Carmelite inspiration. The same bishop wrote the rule on February 6, 1826; and twenty days later, Joachina and another eight women professed their vows. Within the next few years, Joaquina's Carmelites founded several houses in Catalonia. During the First Carlist War (a civil war in Spain from 1833 to 1839), she had to flee the country because she had founded a hospital in the Carlist town of Berga that was threatened by the fighting. As a result, she went to Roussillon, France, where she stayed from 1836 to 1842. Joaquina's apostolic congregation was definitively approved in 1850. In spite of serious challenges posed by civil war and secular opposition, the institute she founded soon spread throughout Catalonia. Thereafter, communities were established throughout Spain and Hispanic America. Eventually, she was forced to resign as superior of her order due to sickness. She passed away during a cholera epidemic in Barcelona, slowly succumbing to paralysis over the final four years of her life. By the time of her death in 1854 at the age of seventy-one, Joaquina was known and admired for her high degree of prayer, deep trust in God and selfless charity. She was beatified by the Roman Catholic Church in 1940, and was canonized in 1959.</p><hr /><h3>St. Paschal Baylon()</h3><hr />"

When he was fifteen, Venantius was arrested, tried and condemned for expressing his faith. Chained to a pillar and scourged, he was miraculously rescued by an angel. He was then burnt with torches and hung over a low fire to be suffocated by smoke. The judge's secretary saw an angel robed in white trampling out the fire and again setting free the youthful martyr. Already an admirer thanks to Venantius' witness, the Secretary proclaimed his faith in Christ, was baptized with his whole family, and shortly after won the martyr's crown. After the Angel trampled out the fire, the judge attempted to make Venantius renounce his faith. Temptations and persuasions failed, so the judge ordered the boy's teeth and jaws to be broken. After maiming Venantius, the judge threw him into a furnace, from which the angel once more delivered him. Venantius was again led before the judge: when the latter fell headlong from his seat and expired. This circumstance being told to the governor, Venantius was thrown to lions. Instead of killing him, the lions crouched at the boy's feet. By order of the governor, Venantius was then dragged through a heap of brambles and thorns, but again God manifested the glory of His servant. The soldiers suffering from thirst, the boy knelt on a rock and signed it with a cross, when immediately a jet of clear, cool water spurted up from the spot.This miracle converted many of those who beheld it, whereupon the governor had Venantius and his converts beheaded together. Their relics are kept in the church at Camerino that bears the Saint's name.</p><hr /><h3>St. John I()</h3><hr />"

But I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.<br />On that day you will not question me about anything. Amen, amen, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Peter Celestine(Pope (1221-1296))</h3><p>SAINT PETER CELESTINE V Pope (1221-1296) As a child, Peter had visions of our Blessed Lady, the angels and saints. They encouraged his prayer and chided him when he fell into any fault. His mother, though a poor widow, sent him to school feeling that he would one day be a saint. At the age of twenty, Peter left his home in Apulia to live in a mountain solitude. Here, he passed three years; and was assaulted by evil spirits. They set upon him with physical attacks and temptations of the flesh. His loyalty to God was even more pleasing when consolations and ecstasies were removed. The demonic retaliations were similar to those suffered by St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Padre Pio and many others. Amidst his struggles with the demonic, angels attended and consoled him. When Peter's seclusion was interrupted by disciples who refused to be sent away, he set a rule of life that became the foundation of the Celestine Order. Angels assisted in the church that Peter built, unseen bells rang peals of surpassing sweetness, and heavenly music filled the sanctuary when he offered the Holy Sacrifice. Peter abruptly found himself torn from his loved solitude by his election to the papacy. His resistance was of no avail. He took the name of Celestine to remind himself of the heaven he was leaving and for which he sighed; and was consecrated at Aquila. After serving for four months, Peter summoned the cardinals to his presence and solemnly resigned his trust. Peter built himself a boarded cell in his palace and there continued his hermit's life. Lest his simplicity be taken advantage of, he was put under guard. He said, \"I desired nothing but a cell, and a cell they have given me.\" He enjoyed his former loving intimacy with the saints and angels, and sang divine praises almost continually. At length, on Whit-Sunday, he told his guards he should die within the week, and immediately fell ill. He received the last sacraments; and the following Saturday, as he finished the concluding verse of Lauds, \"Let every spirit bless the Lord!\" he closed his eyes to this world and opened them to eternity.</p><hr /><h3>St. Yvo(Priest (1253-1303))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT YVO Priest (1253-1303) St. Yvo Helori was from a virtuous patrician family near Treguier, Brittany. When he was fourteen, he went to Paris and later Orleans to study. His mother often encouraged him to live in a manner becoming of a saint, to which he would respond, \"I hope to be.\" This resolution took deep root in Yvo's soul, spurring him to virtue and checking the least shadow of any dangerous course. Yvo's time was chiefly divided between study and prayer. For works of mercy, he visited hospitals to attend and comfort the sick. He made a private vow of perpetual chastity, but this not being known, many honorable matches were proposed to him, which he modestly rejected as incompatible with his studious life. He long deliberated whether to embrace a religious or a clerical state, but the desire of serving his neighbor made him choose the latter. He wished, out of humility, to remain in the lesser orders, but his bishop compelled him to receive the priesthood. He had qualified himself for that sacred dignity through the utmost purity of mind and body, and by a long and fervent preparation. He was appointed ecclesiastical judge for the diocese of Rennes. Fr. Yvo protected orphans and widows, defended the poor, and administered justice to all with an impartiality, application and tenderness that gained him the good-will even of those who lost their causes. He was surnamed the advocate and lawyer of the poor. He built a house near his own for a hospital of the poor and sick. He washed their feet, cleansed their ulcers, served them at table and helped himself last of all, taking meager portions. He distributed his corn, or the price for which he sold it, among the poor immediately after the harvest. When a certain person endeavored to persuade him to keep it some months, that he might sell it at a better price, he answered, \"I know not whether I shall be then alive to give it.\" Another time, the same person said to him, \"I have gained a fifth by keeping my corn.\" \"But I,\" replied the Saint, \"a hundredfold by giving it immediately away.\" During the Lent of 1303, Fr. Yvo felt his strength failing him. Yet, far from abating anything in his austerities, he thought himself obliged to redouble his fervor. On the eve of the Ascension, he preached, said Mass while being upheld by two persons, and gave advice to all who addressed themselves to him. After this, he lay down on his bed, which was a hurdle of twigs plaited together, and received the last sacraments. From that moment, he entertained himself with God alone, till his soul went to possess Him in His glory.He joined the Church Triumphant on May 19, 1303, in the fiftieth year of his age.</p>"

This unknown friar was Bernardine. In his youth, Bernardine undertook the charge of a holy elderly woman, a relation of his, who had been left destitute. She was blind and bedridden, and during her long illness could only utter the Holy Name. Bernardine cared for her till she passed away, and thus learned the devotion of his life. Owing to a speech impediment, Bernardine's success as a preacher seemed doubtful, but, by the prayers of Our Lady, this obstacle was miraculously removed, and Bernardine began an apostolate which lasted thirty-eight years. By his inspired words and the Holy Name of Jesus, which he displayed on a tablet at the end of his sermons, Bernardine obtained miraculous conversions and reformed the greater part of Italy. Bernardine's success had to be exalted by the cross. The Saint was denounced as a heretic and his devotion as idolatrous. After many trials, he lived to see his innocence proved, and a lasting memorial of his work established in the Church. The Feast of the Holy Name commemorates at once his sufferings and his triumph. Bernardine passed away on Ascension Eve, 1444, while his brethren were chanting the antiphon, \"Father, I have manifested Thy Name to men.\"</p>"

His parents, Rafael Magallanes and Clara Jara, were poor farmers and devout Catholics. Growing up on a farm, youngCristóbal worked as a shepherd, but felt truly called to look after Christ's sheep. At the age of nineteen, he entered the seminary, and was ordained a priest when he was thirty. He taught school in Guadalajara for a time until returning to hishome village of Totatiche to minister as a parish priest. He served there for nearly two decades, opening a carpentry business to provide jobs for local men and helping plan and construct a dam to aid the people of the area. But Father Magallanes was most interested in bringing the Catholic faith to those who had not heard the Good News of Jesus, in this case the Huichol people in the region. During this time in Mexico’s history, the government feared the power of the Catholic Church, and it tried to eliminate the practice of the faith. A constitution even banned the training of priests, and the seminary where youngCristóbal had studied was closed and turned into a museum. So in 1915, Father Magallanes opened his own small seminary in Totatiche and soon had more than a dozen students. The government did not look kindly on this kind of behavior and accused the priest of trying to incite rebellion, even though he preached against violence of any kind.He was on his way to celebrate Mass when he was arrested. Without a trial, he was convicted. He gave away his few possessions to his jailers, and on May 21, 1927, he and twenty-one other priests and three lay Catholics were executed.His last words to his executioners were, “I die innocent, and ask God that my blood may serve to unite my Mexican brethren.” St. Cristóbal wascanonizedbyPope John Paul IIon May 21, 2000.</p><hr /><h3>St. Eugene de Mazenod(Bishop (1782-1861))</h3><hr /><p>Eugene de Mazenod Bishop of Marseille, founder of the Congregation of the Missionaries, Oblates of Mary Immaculate (1782-1861) CHARLES JOSEPH EUGENE DE MAZENOD came into a world that was destined to change very quickly. Born in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France on August 1, 1782, he seemed assured of position and wealth from his family, who were of the minor nobility. However, the turmoil of the French Revolution changed all that forever. When Eugene was just eight years old, his family fled France, leaving their possessions behind, and started a long and increasingly difficult eleven-year exile.The Years in Italy The Mazenod family, political refugees, trailed through a succession of cities in Italy. His father, who had been President of the Court of Accounts, Aids and Finances in Aix, was forced to try his hand at trade to support his family. He proved to be a poor businessman, and as the years went on the family came close to destitution. Eugene studied briefly at the College of Nobles in Turin, but a move to Venice meant the end to formal schooling. A sympathetic priest, Don Bartolo Zinelli, living nearby, undertook to educate the young French emigre. Don Bartolo gave the adolescent Eugene a fundamental education, but with a lasting sense of God and a regimen of piety which was to stay with him always, despite the ups and downs of his life. A further move to Naples because of financial problems, led to a time of boredom and helplessness. The family moved again, this time to Palermo where, thanks to the kindness of the Duke and Duchess of Cannizzaro, Eugene had his first taste of noble living and found it very much to his liking. He took to himself the title of \"Count\" de Mazenod, did all the courtly things and dreamed of a bright future.Return to France: the Priesthood In 1802, at the age of twenty, Eugene was able to return to his homeland: and all his dreams and illusions were quickly shattered. He was just plain \"Citizen\" de Mazenod, France was a changed world, his parents had separated, and his mother was fighting to get back the family possessions. She was also intent on marrying off Eugene to the richest possible heiress. He sank into depression, seeing little real future for himself. But his natural qualities of concern for others, together with the faith fostered in Venice, began to assert themselves. He was deeply affected by the disastrous situation of the French Church, which had been ridiculed, attacked and decimated by the Revolution. A calling to the priesthood began to manifest itself, and Eugene answered that call. Despite opposition from his mother, he entered the seminary of St. Sulpice in Paris, and on December 21, 1811, he was ordained a priest in Amiens.Apostolic endeavors: Oblates of Mary Immaculate Returning to Aix-en-Provence, he did not take up a normal parish appointment, but started to exercise his priesthood in the care of the truly spiritually-needy: prisoners, youth, servants and country villagers. Often in the face of opposition from the local clergy, Eugene pursued his course. Soon, he sought out other equally zealous priests who were prepared to step outside the old, even outmoded, structures. Eugene and his men preached in Provencal, the language of the common people, not in \"educated\" French. They went from village to village, instructing at the level of the people, spending amazingly long hours in the confessional. In between these parish missions, the group joined in an intense community life of prayer, study and fellowship. They called themselves \"Missionaries of Provence.\" However, so that there would be an assured continuity in the work, Eugene took the bold step of going directly to the Pope and asking that his group be recognized officially as a Religious Congregation of pontifical right. His faith and his persistence paid off, and on February 17, 1826, Pope Leo XII approved the new Congregation, the \"Oblates of Mary Immaculate.\" Eugene was elected Superior General, and continued to inspire and guide his men for thirty-five years until his death. Together with their growing apostolic endeavors - preaching, youth work, care of shrines, prison chaplaincy, confessors, direction of seminaries, parishes - Eugene insisted on deep spiritual formation and a close community life. He was a man who loved Christ and was always ready to take on any apostolate if he saw it answering the needs of the Church. The \"glory of God, the good of the Church and the sanctification of souls\" were impelling forces for him.Bishop of Marseilles The Diocese of Marseilles had been suppressed after the 1802 Concordat; and when it was re-established, Eugene's aged uncle, Canon Fortune de Mazenod, was named Bishop. He appointed Eugene Vicar General immediately, and most of the difficult work of rebuilding the Diocese fell to him. Within a few years, in 1832, Eugene himself was named auxiliary bishop. His Episcopal ordination took place in Rome, in defiance of the pretensions of the French Government that it had the right to sanction all such appointments. This caused a bitter diplomatic battle, and Eugene was caught in the middle with accusations, misunderstandings, threats and recriminations swirling around him. It was an especially devastating time for him, further complicated by the growing pains of his religious family. Though battered, Eugene steered ahead resolutely, and finally the impasse was broken. Five years later, he was appointed to the See of Marseilles as its bishop, when Bishop Fortune retired.A heart as big as the world While the Oblates of Mary Immaculate was founded to serve the spiritually needy and deprived in the French countryside, Eugene's zeal for the Kingdom of God and his devotion to the Church moved the Oblates to the advancing edge of the apostolate. His men ventured into Switzerland, England and Ireland. Because of his zeal, Eugene was dubbed \"a second Paul,\" and bishops from the missions came to him asking for Oblates for their expanding mission fields. Eugene responded willingly: Despite small initial numbers, he sent his men out to Canada, the United States, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), South Africa and Basutoland (Lesotho). As missionaries in his mould, they fanned out: preaching, baptising and caring. They frequently opened up previously uncharted lands, established and manned many new dioceses, and in a multitude of ways, they \"left nothing undared that the Kingdom of Christ might be advanced.\" In the years that followed, the Oblate mission thrust continued, so that today the impulse of Eugene de Mazenod is alive in his men in sixty-eight different countries.Pastor of his Diocese During all this ferment of missionary activity, Eugene was an outstanding pastor of the Church of Marseilles: ensuring the best seminary training for his priests, establishing new parishes, building the city's cathedral and the spectacular Shrine of Notre Dame de la Garde above the city. He encouraged his priests to lives of holiness, introduced many Religious Congregations to work in the diocese and led his fellow Bishops in support of the rights of the Pope. He grew into a towering figure in the French Church. In 1856, Napoleon III appointed him a Senator, and at his death he was the senior bishop of France.Legacy of a Saint May 21, 1861, saw Eugene de Mazenod taken up by God at the age of seventy-nine, after a life crowded with achievements, many of them born in suffering. For his religious family and for his diocese, he was a founding and life-giving source: For God and for the Church, he was a faithful and generous son. As he lay dying, he left his Oblates a final testament, \"Among yourselves, charity, charity, charity: In the world, zeal for souls.\" He was canonized by Pope John Paul II on December 3, 1995.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hospitius(Recluse (+ 681))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT HOSPITIUS, Recluse (+681) St. Hospitius took sanctuary in the ruins of an old tower near Villafranca, one league from Nice in Provence. He girded himself with a heavy iron chain and lived on bread and dates. During Lent, he ate only roots in order to fast and conform his life to the anchorites of Egypt. Hospitius had the gifts of prophecy and miracles. He foretold the ravages of the Lombards in Gaul. When the Lombards arrived at the tower where he lived, they saw his chain and mistook him for a criminal. On questioning him, Hospitius acknowledged that he was a great sinner and unworthy to live, whereupon one of the soldiers lifted his sword to strike. In that moment, the soldier's arm stiffened and became numb; and it was not until Hospitius made the sign of the cross over it that the man recovered. The soldier embraced Christianity, renounced the world and passed the rest of his days serving God. When Hospitius felt his last hour had arrived, he removed his chain and knelt in prayer. Then, stretching himself on a little bank of earth, he calmly gave up his soul to God on May 21, 681.</p>"

Her parents opposed her desire to become a nun and persuaded her to marry. However, Rita's cruel husband lost his reputation in a short time. After being converted from his wicked ways, Rita's husband was murdered. Her two sons resolved to take revenge, but through Rita's prayers, they never committed mortal sin. After her sons passed away, Rita applied several times for admission into the Augustinian Convent at Cascia. She was repeatedly refused until God cleared the obstacles. She entered the convent, made her profession, and lived the life of a holy and devout religious for forty-two years: \"A shining example of every Christian virtue, pure as a lily, simple as a dove, and obedient as an angel.\" That \"God is wonderful in His Saints\" is easily proved in the life of St. Rita.

When Julia was not working, she spent her time praying and reading. Eusebius, charmed by Julia's fidelity and virtues, took her with him on one of his voyages to Gaul. When they reached the northern part of Corsica, Eusebius cast anchor and went on shore to join the pagans in an idolatrous festival. Julia was left at a distance because she declined. Noticing Julia, the governor, Felix, asked why she dared insult the gods. Eusebius replied that Julia was Christian and all his authority could not make her deny Jesus. Nonetheless, he found her so diligent and faithful that he could not part with her. The Governor offered him four of his best female slaves in exchange for Julia, but the merchant replied, \"All you are worth cannot purchase her. I would freely lose the most valuable thing I have rather than be deprived of her.\" When Eusebius was drunk and asleep, the Governor threatened Julia and ordered her to sacrifice to pagan spirits. He even offered her freedom if she complied. Julia answered that she was free so long as she was allowed to serve Christ. Felix, thinking himself derided, struck her on the face. He then sentenced Julia to have her hair torn off and her body hung from a cross until she died. Certain monks of the isle of Gorgon interred Julia's body. In 763, Desiderius, the king of Lombardy, moved St. Julia's relics to Brescia, where her memory is celebrated with great devotion.</p>"

He was denounced by the queen for paganism to Pope Gregory the Great, but the Pope completely exonerated him. Bp. Desiderius was then banished by a synod controlled by Brunhildis.He returned four years later, but was murdered by three followers of King Theodoric whom he had publicly censured. Free speech as the foundation of Western Civilization was exemplified by St. Desiderius. \"Unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit\" (Jn. 12:24).

Rogatian, unable to resist his brother's example of piety, desired to be baptized. However, the bishop had concealed himself due to persecution.

Rogatian grieved that he was unable to receive the Sacrament of Baptism and prayed his brother's peaceful kiss might supply it. Donatian also prayed that Rogatian's faith would procure the effect of Baptism, and the effusion of his blood the Sacrament of Confirmation. They passed the night together in fervent prayer. The next day, when they were brought before the prefect, they refused to apostate and were stretched on a rack. Afterward, their hands were pierced with lances; and they were dismembered.

He was consecrated to God at the age of 7 and entrusted to the care of St. Benedict Biscop at Wearmouth. He became a monk in the sister-house of Jarrow; and there trained no less than six hundred scholars, whom his piety, learning and sweet disposition had gathered around him. To the toils of teaching and the exact observance of his rule, he added long hours of private prayer and the study of every branch of science and literature. He was familiar with Latin, Greek and Hebrew. In the treatise that he compiled for his scholars, still extant, he threw together all that the world had stored in history, chronology, physics, music, philosophy, poetry, arithmetic and medicine. In his Ecclesiastical History, he has left us the beautiful lives of Anglo-Saxon Saints and holy Fathers, while his commentaries on the Holy Scriptures are still in use by the Church. It was to the study of the Divine Word that he devoted the whole energy of his soul; and at times his compunction was so overpowering that his voice would break with weeping. Straining at the limits of human intellect, Bede toiled to translate scripture into his native tongue. During his later years, he suffered from constant illness, yet he worked and prayed up to his last hour. Venerable Bede was employed in translating the Gospel of St. John from Greek up to the hour of his death, which took place on Ascension Day, 735. \"He spent that day joyfully,\" writes one of his scholars. In the evening, the boy attendeding him said, \"Dear master, there is yet one sentence unwritten.\" He answered, \"Write it quickly.\" Presently the youth said, \"Now it is written.\" He replied, \"Good! Thou hast said the truth-consummatum est. Take my head and face me toward the old praying-place, so I may call upon my Father.\" And so, on the floor of his cell, he sang, \"Glory be to the Father, Son and Holy Ghost;\" and just as he said \"Holy Ghost,\" he breathed his last, and went to God in eternity.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory VII(Pope (c. 1013-1085))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GREGORY VII Pope (c. 1013 - 1085) Gregory VII, by name Hildebrand, was born in Tuscany around 1013. Educated in Rome, he went to France and became a monk at Cluny. When he returned, he filled high trusts of the Holy See for many years. Three great evils then afflicted the Church: simony, concubinage and the custom of receiving investiture from lay hands. Against these three corruptions, Gregory never ceased to contend. As legate of Victor II, he condemned simony at a council in Lyons. When Gregory was elected Pope in 1073, he immediately ordered the clergy to reject secular influence on Church affairs. Rome was then in rebellion through the ambition of the Cenci. They laid hands on him at Christmas during the midnight Mass, wounded him and cast him into prison. The following day, he was rescued by the people. Next arose Gregory's conflict with Henry IV, Emperor of Germany. After Henry relapsed into simony and pretended to depose the Pope, Gregory excommunicated him. Henry's subjects then turned against him and he sought absolution from the Pope at Canossa.Unfortunately, Henry's insincerity and ambitiousness got the better of him. He set up an antipope and besieged Gregory in the castle of St. Angelo.The aged pontiff was obliged to flee. On May 25, 1085, around the 72nd year of his life and the twelfth of his pontificate, Gregory went to his eternal reward. The miracles proceeding from his intercession and proof of his heroic virtues saw him canonized in 1748.</p><hr /><h3>Bl.

In 1923, he completed his course in the theological faculty at Lviv University. On April 5, 1925, Metropolitan Andriy Sheptytsky ordained him to the priesthood. Fr. Mykola was a zealous priest who took care of the spirituality, education and welfare of his parishioners. He was the parish priest in the village of Soroko, where he built a new church. After World War II, the era of total repressions began. Fr. Mykola personally experienced intimidation, threats and beatings. On October 28, 1946, Fr. Mykola was arrested. On January 27, 1947, he was sentenced to ten years in prison. Although he had a wife, two sons and two daughters, he was deported to labor camps in Mordovia. He lived in extremely horrid conditions, in a camp that was notoriously strict and cruel. Fr. Mykola suffered from severe pain and died a martyr on May 25, 1951. Miracles from his intercession and proof of his heroic virtues show that he gained the beatific vision. He was beatified with twenty-four other Greek-Catholics by Pope John Paul II on June 27, 2001, at Lliv.</p>"

After a holy childhood, Philip left Florence to travel, but renounced the world and its favors to pursue a religious vocation. While receiving spiritual formation in Rome, theHoly Spirit alighted upon Philip in visible form, filling his soul with grace. He would have gone to India, but God reserved him for Rome. Day by day, Philip drew souls to Jesus, edifying them through mortifications, charity and cheerful devotions. Thus, under the hands of Mary, as he said, the Oratory grew up, and all Rome was pervaded and transformed by its spirit. Philip's life was a continuous miracle. His habitual state of ecstasy was possible through prayer, mortifications, penance, works of mercy and the Sacraments. He read the hearts of men, foretold their future and knew their eternal destiny. His touch gave health of body: his very look calmed souls in trouble and drove away temptations. \"When I met him in the street,\" says one, \"he would pat my cheek and say, 'Well, how is Don Pellegrino?' and leave me so full of joy that I could not tell which way I was going.\" Philip inspired boundless confidence and love and was the common refuge and consoler of all. When sad or perplexed,Fabrizio de Massimi would stand at Philip's door. He said it was enough to see him, to be near him. Others said that when he playfully pulled their hair or their ears, their hearts would bound with joy. Marcio Altieri felt such overflowing gladness in his presence that he said Philip's room was a paradise on earth. Long after Philip's death, it was enough for many, when troubled, to go into his room to find their hearts lightened and gladdened. Philip Neri passed away at 80 in 1595. He bears the title \"Apostle of Rome.\"</p>"

He received all who came to him,<br />and with complete assurance and without hindrance he proclaimed the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>11(10),4.5.7.</em><p>The LORD is in his holy temple; <br />the LORD's throne is in heaven. <br />His eyes behold, <br />his searching glance is on mankind.<br />The LORD searches the just and the wicked; <br />the lover of violence he hates.<br />For the LORD is just, he loves just deeds; <br />the upright shall see his face.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>21,20-25.</em><p>Peter turned and saw the disciple following whom Jesus loved, the one who had also reclined upon his chest during the supper and had said, \"Master, who is the one who will betray you?\"<br />When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, \"Lord, what about him?\"<br />Jesus said to him, \"What if I want him to remain until I come? What concern is it of yours? You follow me.\"<br />So the word spread among the brothers that that disciple would not die. But Jesus had not told him that he would not die, just \"What if I want him to remain until I come? (What concern is it of yours?)\"<br />It is this disciple who testifies to these things and has written them, and we know that his testimony is true.<br />There are also many other things that Jesus did, but if these were to be described individually, I do not think the whole world would contain the books that would be written.</p><hr /><h3>St. Augustine of Canterbury(Bishop (+ 605))</h3><p>SAINT AUGUSTINE Bishop and Apostle of England (+ 605) Augustine was the prior of the monastery of St. Andrew on the Cœlian Hill, when St. Gregory appointed him leader of the missionaries sent to England. Hearing reports of barbarism and ferocity, Augustine's companions wished to turn back. St. Gregory replied, \"Go on in God's name. The greater your hardships, the greater your crown. If I cannot share your toil, I shall yet share the harvest, for God knows it is not good will that is wanting.\" Obediently, the band pushed forward. Landing at Ebbsfleet, between Sandwich and Ramsgate, they met King Ethelbert and his thanes under a great oak-tree at Minster and announced the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Instant and complete success attended their preaching. On Whit-Sunday, 596, King Ethelbert was baptized; and his example was followed by the greater number of his nobles and people. By degrees, the Faith spread far and wide, and Augustine, as Papal Legate, set out on a visitation of Britain. He failed in his attempt to enlist the Britons of the west, but his success was triumphant from south to north. Bp. Augustine passed away after eight years of evangelical labors. The Anglo-Saxon Church he founded is renowned for its learning, zeal and devotion to the Holy See, while its calendar commemorates no less than three hundred saints, half of whom were of royal birth.</p>"

The disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.<br />(Jesus) said to them again, \"Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.\"<br />And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, \"Receive the holy Spirit.<br />Whose sins you forgive are forgiven them, and whose sins you retain are retained.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Germanus of Paris(Bishop (c. 496 - 576))</h3><p>SAINT GERMANUS Bishop (c. 496 - 576) St. Germanus, the glory of the Church of France in the sixth century, was born in the territory of Autun. In his youth, he was conspicuous for his fervor. After ordination, he was made abbot of St. Symphorian's. He was favored with miracles and prophecy. Germanus' custom was to watch a great part of the night in prayer while his monks slept. One night, in a dream, he thought a venerable old man presented him with the keys of the city of Paris, and said to him that God committed Parisians to his care.Four years after the vision, in 554, Germanus happened to be in Paris when Bishop Eusebius passed away: Hence Germanus was exalted to the episcopal chair. The promotion made no alteration in Germanus' mode of life. The same simplicity and frugality appeared in his mannerisms and lifestyle. His house was frequently crowded with the poor and afflicted, and he always received beggars at his dining table. God blessed Bp. Germanus' sermons so greatly that the Word penetrated the hearts of his listeners and changed the city in a very short time. King Childebert was worldly and ambitious, but found himself converted by Germanus' prayers, words and deeds. The king founded many religious institutions and sent large sums of money to Germanus for distribution among the poor. Germanus' prayer life was clearly in step with his public life. In his old age, Germanus zealously performed his duties with the activity he showed in his youth. Neither could physical weakness make him slacken his penances and mortifications. Through his efforts, the remains of idolatry were extirpated from France. Bp. Germanus continued laboring for the conversion of sinners until he was 80. He was called to Paradise on May 28, 576.</p>"

You have eaten, then, from the tree of which I had forbidden you to eat!\"<br />The man replied, \"The woman whom you put here with me--she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate it.\"<br />The LORD God then asked the woman, \"Why did you do such a thing?\" The woman answered, \"The serpent tricked me into it, so I ate it.\"<br />Then the LORD God said to the serpent: \"Because you have done this, you shall be banned from all the animals and from all the wild creatures; On your belly shall you crawl, and dirt shall you eat all the days of your life.<br />I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; He will strike at your head, while you strike at his heel.\"<br />The man called his wife Eve, because she became the mother of all the living.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>87(86),1-2.3.5.6-7.</em><p>His foundation upon the holy mountains,<br />the LORD loves:<br />the gates of Zion, <br />more than any dwelling of Jacob.<br />Glorious things are said of you, <br />O city of God!<br />and of Zion they shall say: <br />“One and all were born in her; <br />and he who has established her <br />is the Most High LORD.”<br />They shall note, when the peoples are enrolled: <br />\"This man was born there.\"<br />And all shall sing, in their festive dance: <br />\"My home is within you.\"</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint John</h3><em>19,25-34.</em><p>Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.<br />When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, \"Woman, behold, your son.\"<br />Then he said to the disciple, \"Behold, your mother.\" And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.<br />After this, aware that everything was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, \"I thirst.\"<br />There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth.<br />When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, \"It is finished.\" And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.<br />Now since it was preparation day, in order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, for the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one, the Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken and they be taken down.<br />So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.<br />But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs,<br />but one soldier thrust his lance into his side, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</p><hr /><h3>St. Mother Orsola (Giulia) Ledóchowska (1865 - 1939)()</h3><p>M. Orsola (Giulia) Ledóchowska Religious (1865-1939) \"If only I knew how to love, to burn and consume oneself in love,\" so Giulia Ledóchowska wrote at 24. She then professed vows as a novice in the Ursuline convent of Krakow. She took the name \"Maria Ursula of Jesus,\" and the words stated above became the guidelines of her entire life. In her mothers' family of Swiss nationality, from the dynasty of the Salis, and her father's Polish family, there were many politicians, military men and ecclesiastics who were involved in the history of Europe and the Church. She was raised in a large family where affectionate and disciplined love was dominant. The first three children, including M. Ursula, chose the consecrated life: Maria Teresa (beatified in 1975) founded the Society of S. Peter Claver, and the younger brother, Vladimiro, became the Father General of the Jesuits. M. Ursula lived in the convent at Krakow for twenty-one years. Her love for the Lord, educational talent and sensibility towards the needs of youngsters in the changing social, political and moral conditions of those times, put her at the center of attention. When women won the right to study in universities, she succeeded in organizing the first boarding-house in Poland for female students; where they not only found a safe place to live and study, but also received a solid religious preparation. This passion, together with the blessing of Pope Pio X, gave her the strength to move into the heart of Russia, which was hostile toward the Church. When, in civilian dress, she left with another Sister for Petersburg, where religious life was prohibited, she did not know that she was headed toward an unknown destination and that the Holy Spirit would lead her on unforeseen paths. In Petersburg, the Mother, with the steadily growing community of nuns, soon established an autonomous structure of the Ursulines. They lived discreetly, under constant surveillance by the secret police, and brought forward an intense educational and religious project that also encouraged friendship between Poles and Russians. When war broke out in 1914, M. Ursula had to leave Russia. She headed for Stockholm, and during her travels to Sweden, Denmark and Norway, her activity concentrated on education, the life of the local Church, giving aid to war victims and on ecumenical work. The house where she lived with her nuns became a point of reference for people of different political and religious orientations. Her strong love for country was equalled by her love of diversity and acceptance of others. Once asked to speak of her political orientation, she promptly answered, \"My policy is love.\" In 1920, M. Ursula, her sisters and a vast number of orphan children of immigrants returned to Poland. The Apostolic Headquarters transformed its autonomous convent to the Ursulines of the Sacred Agonising Heart ofJesus. The spirituality of the congregation is concentrated on the contemplation of the salvific love of Christ and participation in His mission by means ofeducational projects and service to others, particularly to the suffering, the lonely and the abandoned. M. Ursula educated her sisters to love God above everything else and to find God in every human being and in all creation. By means of her smile and serenity of soul, she gave a particularly credible testimony to the personal bond with Christ and to being an efficient instrument of both evangelical and educational influence. Her humility and capacity to live the ordinary, everyday routine as a privileged road towards holiness made her a clear example of this lifestyle. The congregation developed quickly in Poland; and on the eastern frontiers of the country, communities of the Ursuline nuns were established. In 1928, the Generalate was established in Rome along with a boarding house for girls who were economically less well-off, in order to give them the possibility to come into contact with the spiritual and religious richness of the heart of the Church and Western Civilization. The Sisters began to work in the poor suburbs of Rome. In 1930, the nuns accompanied girls in search of work and established themselves in France. Wherever possible, M.Ursula founded educational and instructional work centers. She sent nuns to Catechise and to work in the poor parts of town. She wrote books and articles for children and youngsters. She initiated and sustained ecclesiastical organisations for children (Eucharistic Movement), for youngsters and for women. She actively participated in the life of the Church and State, thus receiving great acknowledgement and decorations from both the State and the Church. When she passed away in Rome on May 29, 1939, people said that she died a saint. Pope John Paul II beatified M. Ursula on June 20, 1983, in Poznan; and canonized her on May 18, 2003, in Rome.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raymond and companions()</h3><hr />"

Like his predecessor, Pope Felix rallied the Church during an era of persecution. Pope Felix's biography begins with the work of unifying a Church under attack from heresies - teachings that contradict or reduce the deposit of faith. During the third council of Antioch in 269, the Church refuted Paul of Samosata's teaching that Jesus was only a man. Paul of Samosata thus forfeited his bishopric. Obstinate to the last, he was also excommunicated. The biographer Alban Butler writes about St. Felix's ending:\"The persecution of Aurelian breaking out, St. Felix, fearless of danger, strengthened the weak, encouraged all, baptized the catechumens and continued to exert himself in converting persons to the Faith. He was martyred like the Apostles in 274.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Joan of Arc(Virgin (1412+1431))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT JOAN OF ARC Virgin (1412-1431) At Domremy, on the Upper Meuse (France), was born on January 6, 1412, of pious parentage, the illustrious heroine St. Joan of Arc. Taught from her earliest years to pray each night: \"O God, save France,\" Joan could not help but conceive an ardent love for her country. While the English were overrunning northern France, Joan, untutored in worldly wisdom, was peacefully tending her flock and learning God's wisdom in prayer at a wayside shrine. Praying with all her heart, soul and mind, Joan heard voices from heaven; and bidden by St. Michael, who appeared to her, to deliver France from the enemy, she hastened to the king and convinced him of her divine mission. Scarcely did her banner, inscribed \"Jesus, Mary,\" appear on the battlefield when the siege of Orleans was lifted. She afterward led Charles VII to be crowned at Rheims. Later, abandoned by the king, she fell into the hands of the English, who gave her a mock trial and burned her as a heretic. But the Maid of Orleans has at last come into her own. With greater pomp than ever a king was crowned, and amid the acclamations of the whole world, on May 13, 1920, Pope Benedict XV canonized her St. Joan of Arc.</p>"

She lived when Christians were more solicitous to live well than to write much: they knew how to die for Christ, but did not compile long books in which vanity has a greater share than charity. Hence no particular account of Petronilla's actions were handed down, but how eminent her sanctity is, we may judge from her place among the apostles, prophets and martyrs. Petronilla is said to have been a daughter of the apostle St. Peter. That St. Peter was married before his vocation to the apostleship, we learn from the Gospel. St. Clement of Alexandria assures us that St. Peter's wife attained to the glory of martyrdom, with St. Peter encouraging her to remember Our Lord. It seems uncertain whether Petronilla was more than a spiritual daughter of that apostle. Petronilla entered \"through the narrow gate\" to be with the Good Shepherd. She was buried on the way to Ardea, where a cemetery and a church bore her name.</p>"
