For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Martin de Porres(Religious (1579-1639))</h3><p>SAINT MARTIN de PORRESReligious(1579-1639) St. Martin was born in Lima, Peru. His Spanish father had abandoned him and his native mother. Thankfully, Martin received Christian formation. He used his brilliant mind to learn medicine and was so successful that he received apprenticeship to a surgeon. He was also pious: praying regularly and receiving Jesus, the Eternal Priest, in the sacraments (Heb. 4:14). When he was 15, Martin sought admission to the Dominican order, but was only received as a servant because of his native heritage. To practice his vocation, St. Martin performed menial labor and begged to provide the Order with food. St. Martin never ate meat, and only charity sustained him through endless acts of penance. St. Martin's superiors broke with social norms when they gave him St. Dominic's habit. His fidelity and patience were tinging on heroism, so they placed him in charge of the infirmary. He ministered to slaves and nobles alike. He worked cheerfully in all circumstances. St. Martin passed away at 59 years old on November 3. The miracles proceeding from his intercession were recognized, but it would be 100 years before he was canonized. He is our intercessor, friend and model of Christian heroism and manhood.</p><hr /><h3>St. Hubert(Bishop (657-727))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT HUBERT Bishop(657-727) St. Hubert's early life is so obscured by popular tradition that we know little of him before his ordination. He is said to have been addicted to hunting and worldly pursuits. One thing is certain: he is the patron saint of hunters. Prayer and grace moved Hubert to renounce vainglory and every human error to seek God. His spirit and fervor saw him recommended to St. Lambert, the bishop of Maestricht, who ordained him a priest. Fr. Hubert was afterward entrusted with administering the diocese. When St. Lambert was murdered in 681, Fr. Hubert was consecrated his successor. With incredible zeal, Bp. Hubert penetrated into the most remote places of the Ardenne. He abolished the worship of idols by introducing mercy instead of sacrifice (Mt. 9:13). As he evangelized, God bestowed upon him the gift of miracles. Bp. Hubert passed away at 70 years old while reciting the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. A faithful shepherd to the end, God took him to heaven. St. Hubert was canonized because of his heroic virtues and the miracles proceeding from his intercession.</p><hr /><h3>St. Winifred()</h3><hr /><p></p>"},

The first said to him, 'I have purchased a field and must go to examine it; I ask you, consider me excused.'<br>And another said, 'I have purchased five yoke of oxen and am on my way to evaluate them; I ask you, consider me excused.'<br>And another said, 'I have just married a woman, and therefore I cannot come.'<br>The servant went and reported this to his master. Then the master of the house in a rage commanded his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in here the poor and the crippled, the blind and the lame.'<br>The servant reported, 'Sir, your orders have been carried out and still there is room.'<br>The master then ordered the servant, 'Go out to the highways and hedgerows and make people come in that my home may be filled.<br>For, I tell you, none of those men who were invited will taste my dinner.'\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Charles Borromeo(Archbishop of Milan († 1584))</h3><p>SAINT CHARLES BORROMEOArchbishop of Milan(1538-1584) Fifty years after the Protestant heresy began, Our Lord raised up a youth to renew the Church. In 1560, St. Charles Borromeo, then 22, was elected cardinal. He and his uncle, Pius IV, administered the Holy See. Charles' first care was the direction of the Council of Trent. He urged its sessions forward, guided it with correspondence from Rome and carried it to its conclusion. Then he began a more arduous work: the execution of its decrees. As the archbishop of Milan, St. Charles enforced the reforms of the Council of Trent and restored the discipline of his see. He founded schools for the poor and seminaries for clerics, and trained his priests to perfection. He maintained clerical discipline while serving as a tender father. He would sit by the roadside to teach a poor man the Pater and the Ave and would enter hovels to administer the sacraments of Christ. During the plague, St. Charles stayed in Milan to minister to the sick and dying. He even sold his bed to support the work. He passed away while following the Good Shepherd and was brought by God to Heaven.</p><hr /><h3>St. Felix of Valois(Co-founder of the Trinitarians (1127-1212))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT FELIX OF VALOIS Hermit and co-founder of the Trinitarians (1127-1212) St. Felix was a son of the Count of Valois. His mother cultivated his spirit and faith. After his parents' unjust divorce, St. Felix's resolution to begin religious life matured. He entrusted his mother' to her pious brother, Thibault, the count of Champagne, and took the Cistercian habit in Clairvaux. St. Felix gained St. Bernard's approval to depart for Italy, where he led an austere life with an aged hermit. When his spiritual director passed away, St. Felix returned to France and lived as a solitary in Cerfroid. There, God inspired him to found an order for the ransoming of Christian slaves. St. John of Matha, moved by a similar impulse, joined St. Felix. Together, they founded the Order of the Holy Trinity. Once the Order expanded, Sts. Felix and John made a pilgrimage to Rome and obtained Pope Innocent III's approbation. The Trinitarians ransomed Christians who were enslaved by the Moors. St. Felix thus spent the next 15 years organizing and developing his foundations. St. Felix passed away in 1212. He continues protecting the Trinitarians and receiving prayers for intercession. Like St. Felix, we should renew the image of Christ in others without human respect and entrust our endeavors to Mary, the Mother of God.</p>"},

She emulatedher family's virtues: shunning worldly vanity and avoiding the occasions of sin. She longed for the consecrated life, but did not tell her parents. She first consulted St. Ouen, who encouraged her and helped her resolution. When St. Bertilla announced her religious vocation, her parents did not oppose it. Rather, they encouraged her. They helped her move to Jouarre, a great monastery in Brie, four leagues from Meaux. There, St. Bertilla was received with great joy and trained in monastic perfection. By her humility toward her sisters, St. Bertilla was like Martha who served Jesus (Lk. 10:38). Her charity was so great that she was appointed prioress to assist the abbess. Around the year 646, she was appointed as the first abbess of the abbey in Chelles. She administered the abbey with heroic virtue for 46 years.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvia()</h3><hr />"},

He was also sponsored by the Monarch in baptism. St. Leonard was so moved by the discourse and example of St. Remigius that he relinquished the world and became a priest. St. Leonard was an apostle to the Franks. He preached in Aquitaine and ministered to prisoners. He distanced himself from influential roles and eventually trained disciples as a hemit. Thus, St. Leonard withdrew to the monastery of Micy near Orleans and afterward to the solitude of Noblac near Limoges. He founded an abbey there, and the town of Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat is named after him. St. Leonard's charity accustomed him to remain active in works of mercy: comforting hospital patients and visiting prisoners. He is alive today in the presence of God and receives prayers for intercession. He is the patron saint of captives and prisoners.</p>"},

Hence, St. Willibrord only converted tribes under Pepin Heristal's dominion. At Pepin's insistence, St. Willibrord was consecrated archbishop of Utrecht. For more than 50 years, he served as archbishop. He built churches, ordained priests, wrought miracles and prophesied.

Her spiritual mastery came by way of the Carmelite vocation. Like St. Mother Teresa, she too experienced spiritual dryness and desolation. Her devotion to the charism of the Carmelites proved dear to the Heart of Jesus Christ, who blessed her with spiritual liberation and ultimate graces. St. Elizabeth was born on July 18, 1880, as Élisabeth Catez, at the military base of Avord in Cher, France. She was the first child of Captain Joseph Catez and Marie Rolland. Her father passed away unexpectedly on October 2, 1887, and the family moved to Dijon. St. Elizabeth's affection for the Carmelite vocation was shared in her letters. \"I can't find words to express my happiness\" she wrote. \"Here there is no longer anything but God. He is All; He suffices and we live by Him alone\" (Letter 91). St. Elizabeth passed away when she was 26 from Addison's disease, which was then uncurable. She gratefully accepted the pain as if it were a gift. Her last words were, \"I am going to Light, to Love, to Life!\" At the end of her life, St. Elizabeth began calling herself Laudem Gloriae, which means, \"praise of glory.\" She said: \"I think that in Heaven my mission will be to draw souls by helping them to go out of themselves in order to cling to God by a wholly simple and loving movement, and to keep them in this great silence within, which will allow God to communicate Himself to them and to transform them into Himself.\" \"I love to penetrate beyond the veil of the soul to this inner sanctuary where we live alone with God. He wants us entirely to himself, and is making there within us a cherished solitude. Listen to everything that is being sung ... in His heart. It is Love, the infinite Love that envelops us and desires to give us a share ... in all His blessedness. The whole Blessed Trinity Dwells in us, the whole of that mystery which will be our vision in heaven. I am 'Elizabeth of the Trinity' - Elizabeth disappearing, losing herself, allowing herself to be invaded by the Three ... All day long let us surrender ourselves to Love, by doing the will of God, under His gaze, with Him, in Him, for Him alone. ... And then, when evening comes, after a dialogue of love that has never stopped in our hearts, let us go to sleep still in love.\"</p><hr /><h3>Bl. John Duns Scotus(O.F.M. (c.1266-1308))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed John Duns Scotus Franciscan Theologian (c. 1266 - 1308) Blessed John (Johannes) Duns Scotus was an influential theologian and philosopher during the High Middle Ages. Born in Duns, in the county of Berwick, Scotland, Bl. John descended from a wealthy farming family. He received the habit of the Friars Minor in Dumfries, where his uncle, Elias Duns, was superior. After a novitiate, he studied in Oxford and Paris, and was ordained to the priesthood on March 17, 1291. Bl. John was nicknamed Doctor Subtilis (the \"Subtle Doctor\") for his penetrating and subtle manner of thought. His most significant contribution was defending the doctrine of Immaculate Conception. During the night of Christmas, 1299, at the Oxford Convent, Bl. John, was immersed in contemplating the adorable mystery of the Incarnation of the Word. He was rapt in ecstasy when the Blessed Mother appeared to him and placed in his arms the Child Jesus, who kissed and embraced him. Bl. John Duns Scotus passed away in 1308 and was buried in the Franciscan church near the famous Cologne Cathedral. His work helped solemnly define the Immaculate Conception of Mary in 1854. He was beatified by Pope John Paul II in St. Peter's Basilica on March 20, 1993.</p><hr /><h3>St. Godfrey(Bishop (1066-1115))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GODFREY Bishop (1066-1115) St. Godfrey was born in the diocese of Soissons. He was ordained a priest at 25 years old. Later, he became abbot of the Abbey of Nogent-sous-Coucy. In 1104, Fr. Godfrey was consecrated bishop of Amiens. To discipline his mind, he mortified his senses and fasted. He rejected self-gratification, enforced clerical celibacy and opposed drunkenness and simony. For most of his time as bishop, Godfrey wished to resign and retire as a Carthusian monk. In 1114, he moved to a monastery, but was recalled a few months later by the people of Amiens. Notably, he took part in the Council of Chálons. In 1115, Bp. Godfrey fell sick and took refuge at the abbey of Saint Crépin in Soissons. He passed away peacefully, like St. Joseph, in the presence of Jesus Christ and Mother Mary.</p>"},

When Theodore marched with the legion into Pontus, he was forced to choose apostasy or death. Instead of renouncing Jesus Christ, hechose death. To conquer Theodore by gentleness, the commander left him in peace, but Theodore used his freedom to torch the great temple of Isis. After a final attempt, the judge ordered him to apostate. Theodore made the sign of the cross and said, \"Jesus Christ is God.\" After torturing Theodore, the judge goaded him to feeling shame, but Theodore never spoke in indignation. By some accounts, while Theodore was being burned to death, a Christian saw his soul rise like a flash of lightning to heaven. Without a doubt, Theodore lives alongside Jesus Christ and the saints forever.</p>"},

He was appointed archdeacon of the Roman Church by St. Celestine and administered together with Pope Sixtus III. When Pope Sixtus passed away, Leo was elected pope. The ceremony took place on St. Michael's day in 440. At the time, Vandals and Huns were invading the provinces of the empire; and Nestorians, Pelagians and other heretics wreaked havoc upon souls. Pope Leo guided the Church through these perils even while the heresy of Eutyches erupted: the latter claiming that Jesus had one unique nature instead of being God and man. Pope Leo responded with the true doctrine of the Incarnation. However, Eutychianism gained a footing among Eastern monks and bishops through the Byzantine court. After three years of toil, Pope Leo brought about the heresy's solemn condemnation at the Council of Chalcedon. The Fathers all signed his tome and exclaimed, \"Peter hath spoken by Leo.\" Soon after, Attila and his Huns broke into Italy and marched through its burning cities toward Rome. Pope Leo went out to meet him and prevailed upon him to turn back. Astonished to see the terrible Attila, the Scourge of God, fresh from the sack of Aquileia, Milan and Pavia, with the rich prize of Rome in his grasp, turn back to the Danube, Attila's chiefs asked why he acted so strangely. Attila replied that he saw two venerable personages, supposedly Sts. Peter and Paul, standing beside Pope Leo. When Rome fell prey to the Vandals two years later, Pope Leo again saved it from destruction. He passed away in 461 after leading the Church for 20 years.</p><hr /><h3>St. Andrew Avellino(Priest (1561-1608))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ANDREW AVELLINO Priest (1521-1608) After a holy youth, Lancelot Avellino was ordained a priest in Naples. When he was 36, he entered the Theatine Order and took the name Andrew to show his love for the Cross. For fifty years, Fr. Andrew was afflicted with a painful rupture, but did not use a carriage. Once, while he was carrying the Viaticum, a storm extinguished the lamps. A heavenly light encircled him, guided his steps and sheltered him from the rain. However, his pain went unrelieved. On the last day of his life, Fr. Andrew rose to celebrate Mass. He was 89 years old. He was so frail that he barely reached the altar. After beginning the Judica, he fell forward in a fit of apoplexy. While laid on a straw mattress, his whole frame was convulsed in agony. Satan approached him in visible form; and then Our Lady's voice was heard. She bid Fr. Andrew's guardian angel send the tempter back to Hell. A calm and holy smile settled upon Fr. Andrew, and he passed away after a grateful salutation to the image of Mother Mary.</p>"},

At 15 years old, he was seized by his father, a pagan soldier, and enrolled in the army. One winter day, when stationed in Amiens, Martin met a beggar who was almost naked and freezing. Having no money, Martin cut his cloak and gave away the half. That night, he saw Our Lord clothed in the half cloak. He heard Jesus say to the angels: \"Martin, yet a catechumen, hath wrapped Me in this garment.\" Martin thus received baptism and later left the army. Martin happily beheld his mother's conversion. However, he was soon driven from his home by Arian heretics. He then sheltered with St. Hilary. Together, they founded the first monastery in France, near Poitiers. In 372, Martin was consecrated bishop of Tours. His flock, though Christian in name, was pagan in heart. Unarmed and attended only by his monks, Bp. Martin destroyed pagan temples and groves. He achieved the people's conversion through prayer, preaching and miracles. St. Martin is thus known as the Apostle of Gaul. Bp. Martin's last 11 years were spent in humble toil. The purity of his soul was manifested by God through many miracles.</p>"},

Her pious family gave her human and supernatural virtues. The Lord led her to the heights of sanctity as a religious and foundress. The turning point in Frances' life was entering the House of Providence in Codogno. She received the religious habit, and while keeping the name Frances, later added Xavier to it in memory of the great Jesuit missionary and patron of the missions. Thanks to Bp. Domenico Maria Gelmini's support, Sr. Frances Xavier left the House of Providence with seven companions and founded the Salesian Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, which received diocesan approval in 1881. Mother Cabrini asked her sisters for evangelical obedience, mortification, renunciation, vigilance of the heart and interior silence as necessary virtues for conforming to Christ. Vocations surprisingly blossomed and the institute rapidly expanded in Lombardy and beyond. The first house was opened in Rome. Papal approval of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart of Jesus came on March 12, 1888, scarcely 8 years after its foundation. Pope Leo XIII asked Mother Cabrini to care for poor Italian immigrants. She longed to go to China, but the pope's words, \"Not to the East, but to the West\" gave her new energy and direction. The invitation of Christ's vicar directed Mother Cabrini toward immigrants who often crossed to the United States in extreme poverty. Mother Cabrini's tireless apostolic work was more and more inspired by her desire to bring salvation to all. She used to say, \"The Heart of Jesus does things in such a hurry that I can barely keep up with Him.\" With a group of sisters, she left for New York on the first of many voyages. As a messenger of hope, she achieved ever new goals in her tireless apostolate: Nicaragua, Brazil and Argentina, in addition to France, Spain and England. Armed with remarkable boldness, Mother Cabrini started schools, hospitals and orphanages for the masses of immigrants. Not knowing the language and lacking the wherewithal to find a respectable place in American society, they were often victimized. Mother Cabrini reached out to them everywhere: in hovels, prisons and mines. She was never intimidated by toil or distance and traveled from New York to New Jersey, from Pennsylvania to Illinois, from California to Louisiana and Colorado. Even today, she is still called Mother Cabrini in the United States. Mother Cabrini was beatified just 21 years after her death in Chicago on December 22, 1917. In 1946, she was canonized by Pope Pius XII. In the Holy Year of 1950, he proclaimed her the patroness of immigrants.</p><hr /><h3>St. Agostina Livia Pietrantoni((1864-1894))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Agostina Livia Pietrantoni (1864-1894) Virgin Congregation of the Sisters of the Charity of Saint Jeanne-Antide Thouret Once there was, and still is, but with a new face now, a village named Pozzaglia in the Sabina hills. There in a blessed house, a cosy nest filled with childrens' voices, lived Olivia, who later was called Livia and took the name Agostina in religious life. Her life, although short, was remarkable and inspired Pope Paul VI to call her, \"simple, transparent, pure, loving...\" Livia was born and baptized on March 27, 1864, in the little village of Pozzaglia Sabina, at an altitude of 800 meters, in a beautiful area bordered by Rieti, Orvinio and Tivoli. She was the second of eleven children. Her parents, Francesco Pietrantoni and Caterina Costantini, were farmers and worked their small plot of land along with a few added plots that they leased. Livia's childhood and youth were imbued with the values of an honest, hard-working and religious family, in a blessed house where \"all were careful to do good and where they often prayed.\" Around 1876, Livia received her first Holy Communion with extraordinary awareness of God's substance and presence in the Eucharist. Very early on, in her large family, where everyone seemed to be a beneficiary to her time and help, she learned from her mother, Caterina, the thoughtfulness and maternal gestures that she showed with such gentleness towards her many younger brothers and sisters. She worked in the fields and looked after the animals before games or school, but was so remarkable that she earned the title of \"teacher\" from her classmates.Work and pride At the age of 7, along with other children, Livia began transporting sacks of stone and sand by the thousands for the road from Orvinio to Poggio Moiano. At the age of 12, she left with other young seasonal workers to harvest olives in Tivoli. She was precociously wise and took on the moral and religious responsibility for her young companions. She supported them in this tough work far from their families and proudly and courageously stood up to arrogant and unscrupulous bosses.Vocation and detachment Livia's wisdom, respect for others, generosity and beauty motivated her mother to find a suitable match. However, Livia chose a religious vocation instead of marriage. To those in the village who attempted to dissuade her, she replied, \"I wish to choose a Congregation in which there is work both day and night.\" Everyone was certain that these words were genuine. A first trip to Rome in the company of her uncle, Fra Matteo, ended in bitter disillusionment: they refused to accept her. A few months later, however, the mother general of the Sisters of Charity of Saint Jeanne-Antide Thouret told Livia that she was expecting her at the generalate. Livia understood that this time she was saying farewell forever. With emotion, she took leave of the village people, all the loved corners of her land, her favorite prayer places, the parish and the Virgin of Rifolta. She kissed her parents goodbye, received Uncle Domenico's blessing, \"kissed the door of her house, traced the sign of the cross on it and left hurriedly...\"Formation and mission Livia was 22 years old when she arrived in Rome on March 23, 1886, at Via S. Maria in Cosmedin. A few months as a postulant and novice proved that she had the makings of a Sister of Charity, that is, of a \"servant of the poor,\" in the tradition of Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Jeanne-Antide. Thanks to her family, she had a particularly solid spiritual foundation. When she received the religious habit and was given the name Sister Agostina, she had the premonition that it fell to her to become the saint bearing this name. Sister Agostina was sent to the Hospital of Santo Spirito. Seven hundred years of glorious history had led it to be called \"the school of Christian charity.\" In the wake of the saints who preceded her, amongst whom were Charles Borromeo, Joseph Casalanz, John Bosco and Camillus de Lellis, Sister Agostina made her personal contribution. In this place where many suffered, she expressed heroic charity.Silence, prayer and goodness The hospital's atmosphere was hostile to religion because of the Roman question. The Capuchin fathers had been expelled and the Crucifix and all other religious signs were prohibited. The hospital administrators only kept the sisters because they feared becoming unpopular. Hence, the sisters' lives were made impossible and they were forbidden to speak about God. Sister Agostina did not need to \"cry out for God,\" but through her life proclaimed the Gospel. First, in the childrens' ward, and later in the tuberculosis ward: a place of despair and death, where she caught the mortal contagion of which she was miraculously healed. She showed total dedication and concern for each sick person, above all for the most difficult, violent and obscene. In secret, in a small hidden corner of the hospital, Sister Agostina commended everyone to the Holy Virgin and promised Our Lady more vigils and greater sacrifices for their conversion. How many times she offered Joseph Romanelli to Our Lady! He was vulgar and insolent toward her while she was attentive toward him and welcomed his blind mother with great kindness during visits. When, after the umpteenth provocation at the expense of the women working in the laundry, the Director expelled Joseph Romanelli from the hospital, the latter sought a target for his fury, and poor Agostina was the victim. Several times, Romanelli sent Sister Agostina death threats scrawled on little notes. When he caught her unaware and struck her to death on November 13, 1894, her lips uttered nothing but invocations to the Holy Virgin Mary and words of forgiveness.</p><hr /><h3>St. Stanislaus Kostka((1551-1568))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT STANISLAUS KOSTKA (1551-1568) St. Stanislaus was from a noble Polish family. At 14 years old, he went with his elder brother, Paul, to the Jesuits' College in Vienna. Stanislaus' austerities were felt as a reproach by Paul, who maltreated him. The abuse and penances brought on a dangerous illness, but Stanislaus could not send for a priest since he was at a Lutheran house. He remembered that his patroness, St. Barbara, never permitted her devotees to die without the Holy Viaticum, so he devoutly appealed to her. She appeared with two angels and gave him the Sacred Host. When Stanislaus was cured, Our Lady bid him enter the Society of Jesus. Stanislaus avoided opposition by departing Vienna. At the Jesuit house, Stanislaus cheerfully performed the most menial tasks. He was then admitted to the Jesuit novitiate in Rome. There, he lived for ten short months: demonstrating rare piety, obedience and devotion. Stanislaus passed away, as he had prayed, on the Feast of the Assumption in 1568, at the age of 17. God brought his soul to Heaven because he gave his life for Jesus' sake (Mt. 16:25). Let us follow his example and never be lukewarm in piety.</p>"},

At 10 years old, his father delivered him as a hostage to the king of Leinster, Dermod Mac Murchad. Lawrence was mistreated him so badly that his father transferred him to the bishop of Glendalough in the county of Wicklow. Lawrence received new lights and graces from the Holy Spirit as he relied upon Jesus' will rather than his own. When the bishop who also served as abbot passed away, Lawrence succeeded him. At 25 years old, Lawrence governed his monastic community with remarkable virtue and prudence. In 1161, he was unanimously chosen to fill the new metropolitan see of Dublin. Around 1171, Abp. Lawrence visited King Henry II in Canterbury about the diocese of Dublin. He was received by the Benedictine monks of Christ Church. The following day, while walking to the altar, a maniac struck him on the head, and everyone present thought he was mortally wounded. To their astonishment, Abp. Lawrence came to himself, asked for some water, blessed it, and having his wound washed with it, the blood was immediately stanched and he celebrated Mass. As with every saint who chose Christ over human respect, Abp. Lawrence had to overcome setbacks and opposition. In response to clerical abuses, he sacked over 150 churchmen during his tenure. He was an authentic pastor who prayed regularly to discern the will of God. In 1175, Henry II of England became infuriated with Ireland's monarch Roderic. Hence, Abp. Lawrence negotiated their reconciliation. King Henry was so moved by Abp. Lawrence's charity and prudence that he left the entire matter to the latter's discretion. St. Lawrence passed away on November 14, 1180. Jesus received his soul into Heaven. His relics are enshrined at the Collegiate Church of Notre-Dame-et-Saint-Laurent d'Eu, while his heart remains in Dublin's Christ Church Cathedral.</p><hr /><h3>St. Sidonius()</h3><hr />"},

He was born in Lauingen, on the Danube in Swabia, and carefully educated from boyhood. To pursue higher learning, he went to Padua. At the urging of the blessed Jordan, Master General of the Order of Preachers, and against the opposition of his uncle, Albert sought admission to the order of St. Dominic. During his novitiate, he was conspicuous for his piety and strict observance of the rule. Albert emulated St. Dominic by accepting the Holy Virgin's spiritual motherhood and by praying Her Rosary. To achieve his potential, he completed his studies in Cologne. Afterward, he was appointed professor in Hildesheim, Fribourg, Ratisbon and Strasbourg. Albert gained fame as a professor in Paris. Among his beloved pupils was Thomas Aquinas, who's great intellect he recognized and acclaimed. In Anagni, in the presence of the Supreme Pontiff Alexander IV, Albert refuted William's allegations against the mendicant orders. Albert was later consecrated bishop of Ratisbon. In giving counsel and settling disputes, Bp. Albert carried himself so admirably that he earned the title of peacemaker. He wrote many things on almost every branch of learning, but especially on sacred subjects. He also composed magnificent works about the Sacrament of the Altar. Bp. Albert passed away in the year 1280. He was venerated in many dioceses and by the Order of Preachers. At the request of the Congregation of Sacred Rites, Pope Pius XI gave him the title of doctor and extended his feast to the universal Church. Pope Pius XII presented him as a patron for students of the natural sciences.</p><hr /><h3>St. Raphael Kalinowski(O.C.D. († 1907))</h3><hr /><p>Raphael Kalinowski O.C.D. (1835-1907) Father Raphael of Saint Joseph Kalinowski was born in Vilna, Lithuania, on September 1, 1835. He was named Joseph in baptism. Through his father's teaching at the Institute for Nobles, he made so much progress that he received the maximum distinction in studies. He afterward studied at the school of agriculture in Hory, Czechia, from 1851 to 1852. From 1853 to 1857, Joseph studied at the Academy of Military Engineering in St. Petersburg, where he obtained his degree and the rank of lieutenant. Afterward, he was appointed lecturer in mathematics at the same academy. In 1859, he took part in designing the Kursk-Kiev-Odessa railway. In 1863, the Polish insurrection broke out against Russia. Joseph resigned from the Russian forces and accepted the post of Minister of War for the region of Vilna in the rebel army. On March 24, 1864, he was arrested and sentenced to death: a penalty that was mitigated to 10 years of hard labor in Siberia. With admirable strength of spirit and patient love for his fellow exiles, Joseph transmitted a spirit of prayer, serenity and hope, while also giving material help and encouragement. After being repatriated in 1874, he accepted the post of tutor to the Venerable Servant of God, Augusto Czartoryski, and lived mainly in Paris. His influence on the young prince was such that Augusto discovered a priestly vocation. The prince was received into the Salesians by their founder, Saint John Bosco, in 1887. Meanwhile, Joseph entered the Discalced Carmelites in Graz, Austria, and received the religious name Brother Raphael of Saint Joseph. After studying theology in Hungary, he was ordained a priest in Czerna, near Krakow, on January 15, 1882. Fr. Raphael assisted his Carmelite brothers and sisters in ascending the mountain of perfection. In the Sacrament of Reconciliation, he lifted up many from the mire of sin. He worked to reunify the Church and bequeathed responsibility to his Carmelite brothers and sisters. His superiors entrusted him with many important offices, which he carried out perfectly until the end. He was taken by God to Heaven on November 15, 1907. He passed away in Wadowice at a monastery he founded. He was buried at the monastery's cemetery in Czerna, near Krakow. Fr. Raphael had remarkable fame for his sanctity, even on the part of the most noble and illustrious persons, such as the Cardinals Dunajewski, Puzyna, Kakowski and Gotti. The Ordinary Process for his eventual beatification was set in motion at the Curia of Krakow from 1934 to 1938. In 1943, the decree was issued concerning his writings. His cause was introduced in 1952, and from 1953 to 1956, the Apostolic Process was conducted where the Congregation discussed his virtues. On October 11, 1980, Pope John Paul II promulgated the decree on the heroicity of Fr. Raphael's virtues. After the approval of the miraculous healing of the Reverend Mis, the Holy Father beatified Fr. Raphael Kalinowski in Krakow on June 22, 1983. As the fame of his miracles increased, the Curia of Krakow, in 1989, set in motion the Canonical Process to investigate the extraordinary healing of a young child. The discussions of the doctors, theologians and cardinals were brought to a happy conclusion. On July 10, 1990, Pope John Paul II, approved the miracle for the canonization. In the Consistory of November 26, 1990, Pope John Paul II, together with the Cardinals, agreed to canonize Blessed Raphael Kalinowski. They set the ceremony for Sunday, November 17, 1991, presenting St. Raphael Kalinowski as a model and patron for the young and the young at heart.</p><hr /><h3>Bl. Mary of the Passion((1839-1904))</h3><hr /><p>Blessed Mary of the Passion Foundress of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary(1839-1904) Bl. Mary was born on May 21, 1839, in Nantes, France. She was baptized Hélène Marie Philippine de Chappotin de Neuville. In April 1856, during a retreat, she first experienced God's calling to a consecrated life. Her mother's unexpected passing delayed her profession of vows. In December 1860, with the bishop's consent, she entered the Poor Clares. She was drawn by St. Francis' simplicity and poverty of spirit. On January 23, 1861, Mary had a profound experience of God who invited her to offer herself as a victim for the Church and the pope. A short time after, she became seriously ill and was obliged to leave the monastery. When she recovered, her confessor directed her towards the Society of Marie Reparatrice, which she entered in 1864. On the following August 15, in Toulouse, she received the religious habit with the name Mary of the Passion. In March 1865, while still a novice, Mary was sent to India, to the Apostolic Vicariate of Madurai, and confided to the Society of Jesus. The Reparatrice sisters were tasked with forming the sisters of the congregation as well as other apostolic activities. It was there that she pronounced temporary vows on May 3, 1866.In July 1867, she was named provincial superior of the three convents of the Reparatrice. Under her guidance, the works of the apostolate developed, peace in the mission was reestablished and fervor and regularity blossomed. In 1874, a new house was founded in Ootacamund, in the Vicariate of Coimbatore, and entrusted to the Paris Foreign Mission Society. However, in 1876, in Madurai, dissensions became so acute that some religious, among them Mary, were driven from the Society. They reunited in Ootacamund under the jurisdiction of the Vicar Apostolic of Coimbatore, Monsignor Joseph Bardou MEP. In November 1876, Mary went to Rome to regularize the situation of the twenty separated sisters. On January 6, 1877, she obtained Pius IX's authorization to found a new missionary institute called the Missionaries of Mary. On the suggestion of the Congregation of Propaganda Fide, Mary opened a novitiate in Saint-Brieuc, France. In April 1880, and in June 1882, Mary went to Rome to resolve the difficulties threatening the Institute. The journey in June 1882 marked an important stage in her life: she was authorized to open a house in Rome and rediscovered Franciscan direction through providential circumstances. On October 4, 1882, in the Church of the Aracoeli, she was received into the Third Order of Saint Francis. She began a friendship with Fr. Bernardin de Portogruaro, the minister general, who supported her with paternal solicitude. In March 1883, because of latent opposition, Mary was deposed as the Institute's superior. However, after an inquiry ordered by Leo XIII, she was vindicated. At the Chapter of July 1884, she was reelected. The Institute of the Missionaries of Mary developed rapidly. On August 12, 1885, both the laudatory decree and that of affiliation to the Order of Friars Minor were issued. The constitutions were approved ad experimentum on July 17, 1890, and definitively on May 11, 1896. Mary's zeal was boundless in responding to the calls of the poor and the abandoned. She was particularly interested in the promotion of women and the social question. With intelligence and discretion, she offered collaboration to pioneers who were working in these spheres. Her intense activity drew its dynamism from contemplation of the great mysteries of faith. For Mary, everything led to the Trinity and unity of God, who is truth communicating itself and seeing itself. It was in union with these mysteries that, in an ecclesial and missionary dimension, she lived her vocation. Jesus in the Eucharist was for her \"The Great Missionary,\" and Our Lady's motherly care traced out for her the path of unconditional love and generosity toward the work. In 1900, Mary's Institute received the seal of blood through the martyrdom of seven Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, who were beatified in 1946 and canonized during the Great Jubilee of the year 2000. To be the spiritual mother of these missionaries who had known how to live to the shedding of their blood was both a great sorrow, a great joy and a time of great emotion. Mary died peacefully in San Remo on November 15, 1904, after a brief illness. She left more than 2,000 religious and 86 houses across four continents. Her relics are venerated in a private oratory of the General House of the Institute of the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary in Rome. In February 1918, in San Remo, the informative process was opened for the cause of beatification and canonization. In 1941, the decree on the writings was promulgated, and during the following years, numerous postulatory letters were addressed to the Holy See from all parts of the world in favor of the cause of the Servant of God. After the consultors had voted unanimously in its favor, the Decree for the Introduction of the Cause was published on January 19, 1979, with the approbation of Pope John Paul II. On June 28, 1999, the Pope solemnly promulgated the decree on the heroicity of the virtues of Mother Mary of the Passion. On March 5, 2002, the healing of a religious suffering from pulmonary and vertebral TBC, Pott's Disease, was recognized as a miracle granted by God through the intercession of the Venerable Mary of the Passion. OnOctober 20, 2002, Mary of the Passion was beatified.</p>"},

Her soul was like a precious pearl. A life amidst the luxury of a royal court never dimmed its lustre or stole it away from Christ. She was the granddaughter of an English king. In 1070, she became the bride of Malcolm and the queen of Scotland. Margaret received the sacraments and promoted the liturgy of the Church. She built churches and monasteries, made vestments and upheld divine and moral laws throughout her realm. She ordered her prayer and norms of piety so prudently that she edified her husband. He rose with her at night for prayer and kissed the holy books she read. Sometimes, he covered her books in jewels. St. Margaret conducted herself with supernatural intention while educating her eight children. She bore the fruits of the Holy Spirit and was her husband's most trusted counsellor. Together, they labored for their country's socio-economic improvement. On her deathbed, St. Margaret received news that her husband and eldest son had been slain in battle. She bore this affliction with humility and as a penance for sins. After receiving the Holy Viaticum, she repeated the Missal's prayer, \"O Lord Jesus Christ, who by Thy death didst give life to the world, deliver me.\" At the words \"deliver me,\" says her biographer, she departed for Christ, the Author of Life (Ac. 3:15).

Above all, she was humble, mortified and obedient in all monastic observances. Gertrude's life was colored with wonder and mystical experiences. She obediently recorded some of her visions where her soul conversed intimately with Jesus and Mary. She was gentle to all, especially to wayward and misguided souls. She was especially devoted to the saints, to souls in purgatory and above all to the Passion of Our Lord and to His Sacred Heart. Gertrude ruled her abbey for 40 years. She suffered from moral and physical pain, but carried her crosses with love. Her longing for Heaven was granted in 1301 or 1302.</p>"},

In her infancy, she was betrothed to Louis Landgrave of Thuringia. To ensure dynastic succession, Elizabeth was brought up in her future-husband's court. Elizabeth became both a queen and a mother to the poor. She received them at the palace daily. She also built several hospitals to serve the sick. She worked at the hospitals and dressed patients' sores. Once, when Elizabeth was carrying provisions for the poor, she saw her husband. He was astonished to see her bending under the weight of her mantle and opened it: He found beautiful red and white roses although it was not the season for flowers. Elizabeth's husband bid her continue the missions, took one of the marvellous roses and kept it all his life. When Elizabeth's husband passed away, she and her children were driven from the palace. With character and heroic virtue, she blessed the Cross, exalted the Holy Names and attended to her family. Through trials and tribulations, she continued advocating for the poor. Queen Elizabeth passed away in 1231 at the age of 24. God granted many miracles through her intercession because she loved Him until the end.</p><hr /><h3>St. Gregory Thaumaturgus(Bishop (3rd century))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT GREGORY THAUMATURGUSBishop(3rd Century) St. Gregory was born in Pontus, near the southern coast of the Black Sea. In 231, he studied philosophy under Origen in Palestine, which led him from the pursuit of human wisdom to Christ. Not long after, Gregory was consecrated bishop of Neo Cæsarea in his own country. While Gregory lay awake one night, an elderly man appeared and pointed to a Lady of supernatural beauty, who radiated heavenly light. The man was St. John the Evangelist, and the Blessed Virgin Mary asked him to instruct Gregory. St. John gave Gregory a creed that contained the full doctrine of the Trinity. Gregory set it in writing, directed all his preaching by it and handed it down to his successors. Bishop Gregory exorcised demons, foretold the future and preserved his flock from heresies. At his word, a rock moved from its place, a river changed its course and a lake dried up. The accounts of his miracles are exceptional, hence his title Thaumaturgus. The Holy Spirit renewed the Church through St. Gregory. When he passed from this life to eternity, the Creed preserved his flock from Arianism. He passed away in 270 and joined the Church Triumphant in Heaven.</p>"},

He told them to send him at once to the abode of the dead, explaining:<br>\"At our age it would be unbecoming to make such a pretense; many young men would think the ninety-year-old Eleazar had gone over to an alien religion.<br>Should I thus dissimulate for the sake of a brief moment of life, they would be led astray by me, while I would bring shame and dishonor on my old age.<br>Even if, for the time being, I avoid the punishment of men, I shall never, whether alive or dead, escape the hands of the Almighty.<br>Therefore, by manfully giving up my life now, I will prove myself worthy of my old age,<br>and I will leave to the young a noble example of how to die willingly and generously for the revered and holy laws.\" He spoke thus, and went immediately to the instrument of torture.<br>Those who shortly before had been kindly disposed, now became hostile toward him because what he had said seemed to them utter madness.<br>When he was about to die under the blows, he groaned and said: \"The Lord in his holy knowledge knows full well that, although I could have escaped death, I am not only enduring terrible pain in my body from this scourging, but also suffering it with joy in my soul because of my devotion to him.\"<br>This is how he died, leaving in his death a model of courage and an unforgettable example of virtue not only for the young but for the whole nation.</p><h3>Psalms</h3><em>3,2-3.4-5.6-7.</em><p>O LORD, how many are my adversaries!<br>Many rise up against me!<br>Many are saying of me,<br>“There is no salvation for him in God.”<br>But you, O LORD, are my shield;<br>my glory, you lift up my head!<br>When I call out to the LORD,<br>he answers me from his holy mountain.<br>When I lie down in sleep,<br>I wake again, for the LORD sustains me.<br>I fear not the myriads of people<br>arrayed against me on every side.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>19,1-10.</em><p>At that time, Jesus came to Jericho and intended to pass through the town.<br>Now a man there named Zacchaeus, who was a chief tax collector and also a wealthy man,<br>was seeking to see who Jesus was; but he could not see him because of the crowd, for he was short in stature.<br>So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree in order to see Jesus, who was about to pass that way.<br>When he reached the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, \"Zacchaeus, come down quickly, for today I must stay at your house.\"<br>And he came down quickly and received him with joy.<br>When they all saw this, they began to grumble, saying, \"He has gone to stay at the house of a sinner.\"<br>But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, \"Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I shall give to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone I shall repay it four times over.\"<br>And Jesus said to him, \"Today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a descendant of Abraham.<br>For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save what was lost.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Rose Philippine Duchesne(Religious (1769-1852))</h3><p>Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne Religious, of the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (1769-1852) Saint Rose Philippine Duchesne was born on August 29, 1769, in Grenoble, France. She was baptized at the Church of St. Louis and named after Rose of Lima and Philip the apostle. She was educated at the Convent of the Visitation of Ste. Marie d'en Haut and became a novice at 18 years old. During the French Revolution, her community was dispersed and she returned to her family home. She spent her time nursing prisoners and those in need. After the Concordat of 1801, she and her companions unsuccessfully tried to reconstruct the monastery of Ste. Marie. In 1804, she learned of a new congregation, the Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and offered herself and the monastery to its foundress, Mother Madeleine Sophie Barat. Mother Barat visited Ste. Marie in 1804 and received Rose and several companions as novices in the Society. While Sr. Rose's desire for the consecrated life deepened, so too her call to the missions became more urgent: a call she had heard since adolescence. In a letter to Mother Barat, she confided her spiritual experience during a night of adoration on Holy Thursday: \"I spent the entire night in the new World ... carrying the Blessed Sacrament to all parts of the land ... I had all my sacrifices to offer: a mother, sisters, family, my mountain! When you say to me 'now I send you,' I will respond quickly 'I go.\"' However, it would be another 12 years. In 1818, Sr. Rose's dream was realized. She was sent to the bishop of the Louisiana territory who was looking for a congregation of educators to teach the native and French children. Near St. Louis, Missouri, in St. Charles, Sr. Rose founded the first house of the Society outside France. It was in a log cabin, and with it came all the austerities of frontier life: extreme cold, hard work and lack of funds. She also had difficulty learning English. Communication at best was slow and news often did not arrive from France. Despite setbacks, Sr. Rose and four other religious of the Sacred Heart forged ahead. In 1820, she opened the first free school west of the Mississippi. By 1828, she had founded six houses. These schools were for the young women of Missouri and Louisiana. She also yearned to serve the natives. When she was 72 and no longer superior, a school for the Potawatomi was opened in Sugar Creek, Kansas. Many thought she was too sick, but the Jesuit head of the mission insisted: \"She must come; she may not be able to do much work, but she will assure success to the mission by praying for us. Her very presence will draw down all manner of heavenly favors on the work.\" Sr. Rose was with the Potawatomi for a year before her health declined. However, her pioneer courage did not weaken, and her long hours of contemplation impelled the natives to name her Quah-kah-ka-num-ad, \"Woman-Who-Prays-Always.\" In July 1842, Sr. Rose returned to St. Charles, although her heart never lost its desire for the missions. She wrote, \"I feel the same longing for the Rocky Mountain missions, and any others like them, that I experienced in France when I first begged to come to America...\" Sr. Rose Philippine Duchesne passed away in St. Charles, Missouri, on November 18, 1852, at the age of 83. The miracles from her intercession are proof of her heroic virtues show that she attained the beatific vision.</p><hr /><h3>St. Odo of Cluny((† 942))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT ODO OF CLUNY ( 942) In 877, on Christmas Eve, a nobleman from Aquitaine implored Jesus and Mary to grant him a son. His prayer was answered and Odo was born. With gratitude, the nobleman consecrated Odo to the Holy Spirit and Saint Martin. Odo was charismatic and talented. He began a novitiate at St. Martin in Tours instead of joining the aristocracy. After some discernment, he took the habit of St. Benedict in Baume. Later, he was elected abbot of the great abbey in Cluny. The pope often called Odo to act as a peacemaker between warring princes. It was on one of these missions that he fell ill. At his entreaty, he was borne from Rome to Tours in 942, where he passed away at his own St. Martin's.</p>"},

Thus, we can see where the Church's journey begins in history.St. Clement, Bishop of Rome during the last years of the first century, was the Successor of Peter after Linus and Anacletus. The most important testimony concerning his life comes from St. Irenaeus, the bishop of Lyons until 202. He attests that Clement \"had seen the blessed Apostles,\" \"had been conversant with them,\" and \"might be said to have the preaching of the apostles still echoing [in his ears], and their traditions before his eyes\" (Adversus Haer. 3, 3, 3).The authority and prestige of St. Clement were such that various writings were attributed to him, but the only one that is certainly his is the Letter to the Corinthians. Eusebius of Caesarea, the great \"archivist\" of Christian beginnings, presents it in these terms: \"There is extant an Epistle of this Clement which is acknowledged to be genuine and is of considerable length and of remarkable merit. He wrote it in the name of the Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth, when a sedition had arisen in the latter Church. We know that this Epistle also has been publicly used in a great many Churches both in former times and in our own\" (Hist. Eccl. 3, 16).An almost canonical character was attributed to this Letter. At the beginning of this text - written in Greek - Clement expressed his regret that \"the sudden and successive calamitous events which have happened to ourselves\" had prevented him from intervening sooner (1, 1). These \"calamitous events\" can be identified with Domitian's persecution. Therefore, the Letter must have been written just after the Emperor's death and at the end of the persecution: immediately after the year 96.Clement's intervention was prompted by the serious problems besetting the Church in Corinth. The elders of the community had been deposed by some young contestants. The sorrowful event was recalled once again by St. Irenaeus who wrote: \"In the time of this Clement, no small dissension having occurred among the brethren in Corinth, the Church in Rome dispatched a most powerful Letter to the Corinthians exhorting them to peace, renewing their faith and declaring the tradition which it had lately received from the Apostles\" (Adv. Haer. 3, 3, 3).Thus, we could say that this Letter was a first exercise of the Roman primacy after St. Peter's death. Clement's Letter touches on topics that were dear to St. Paul, who had written two important Letters to the Corinthians, in particular the theological dialectic, perennially current, between the indicative of salvation and the imperative of moral commitment.First of all came the joyful proclamation of saving grace. The Lord forewarns us and gives us his forgiveness, gives us his love and the grace to be Christians: his brothers and sisters. It is a proclamation that fills our life with joy and gives certainty to our action. The Lord always forewarns us with his goodness and the Lord's goodness is always greater than all our sins. However, we must commit ourselves in a way that is consistent with the gift received and respond to the proclamation of salvation with a generous and courageous journey of conversion.The Letter's immediate circumstances provided the Bishop of Rome with ample room for an intervention on the Church's identity and mission. If there were abuses in Corinth, Clement observed, the reason should be sought in the weakening of charity and of the other indispensable Christian virtues. He therefore calls the faithful to humility and fraternal love, two truly constitutive virtues of being in the Church: \"Seeing, therefore, that we are the portion of the Holy One,\" he warned, \"let us do all those things which pertain to holiness\" (30, 1).\"The Lord (delegated) peculiar services (Baptism, Last Supper, etc.) to the high priest, and their own proper place is prescribed to the priests, and their own special ministries devolve on the Levites. The layman is bound by the laws that pertain to laymen\" (40, 1-5). It can be noted that here, in this early first-century Letter, the Greek word \"laikós\" appears for the first time in Christian literature, meaning \"a member of the laos\"(that is, \"of the People of God\"). ... Each one (in the Church) ... exercises his ministry in accordance with the vocation he has received.The Father sent Jesus Christ, who in turn sent the Apostles. They then sent the first heads of communities and established that they would be succeeded by other worthy men. Everything, therefore, was made \"in an orderly way, according to the will of God\" (42). With these words, St. Clement underlined that the Church's structure was sacramental and not political. The action of God who comes to meet us in the liturgy precedes our decisions and our ideas. The Church is above all a gift of God and not something we ourselves created. Consequently, this sacramental structure not only guarantees the common order, but also this precedence of God's gift which we all need.Finally, the \"great prayer\" confers a cosmic breath to the previous reasoning. ... The prayer for rulers and governors acquires special importance. Subsequent to the New Testament texts, it is the oldest prayer extant for political institutions. Thus, in the period following their persecution, Christians, well aware that the persecutions would continue, never ceased to pray for the very authorities who had unjustly condemned them. The reason is primarily Christological: it is necessary to pray for one's persecutors as Jesus did on the Cross. But this prayer also contains a teaching that guides the attitude of Christians towards politics and the State down the centuries. In praying for the Authorities, Clement recognized the legitimacy of political institutions in the order established by God; ... and expressed his concern that the Authorities would be docile to God, \"devoutly in peace and meekness exercising the power given them by [God]\" (61, 2).Another sovereignty emerges whose origins and essence are not of this world but of \"the heavens above\": it is that of Truth, which also claims a right to be heard by the State. ... Let us make our own the invocations of the \"great prayer\" in which the Bishop of Rome made himself the voice of the entire world: \"O Lord, make your face to shine upon us for good in peace, that we may be shielded by your mighty hand ... through the High Priest and Guardian of our souls, Jesus Christ, through whom be glory and majesty to you both now and from generation to generation, for evermore\" (60-61).BENEDICT XVI General audience (March 7, 2007)</p><hr /><h3>St. Columban(Abbot († 615))</h3><hr /><p>SAINT COLUMBAN Abbot( 615) St. Columban was born in Ireland during the seventh century. Early in life, he discerned a religious vocation. For leisure, he read spiritual and theological books. After being ordained, Columban went to France and founded several monasteries. He denounced the immoral practices of royal and clerical persons and was exiled. He then went to Italy and founded the monastery of Bobbio. St. Columban reformed clerical organizations and evangelized Europe like many Irish saints. The institutes he founded preserved Western literature and disseminated Christendom.

The king allotted them a daily portion of food and wine from the royal table.<br>Among these were men of Judah: Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.<br>But Daniel was resolved not to defile himself with the king's food or wine; so he begged the chief chamberlain to spare him this defilement.<br>Though God had given Daniel the favor and sympathy of the chief chamberlain,<br>he nevertheless said to Daniel, \"I am afraid of my lord the king; it is he who allotted your food and drink. If he sees that you look wretched by comparison with the other young men of your age, you will endanger my life with the king.\"<br>Then Daniel said to the steward whom the chief chamberlain had put in charge of Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,<br>\"Please test your servants for ten days. Give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.<br>Then see how we look in comparison with the other young men who eat from the royal table, and treat your servants according to what you see.\"<br>He acceded to this request, and tested them for ten days;<br>after ten days they looked healthier and better fed than any of the young men who ate from the royal table.<br>So the steward continued to take away the food and wine they were to receive, and gave them vegetables.<br>To these four young men God gave knowledge and proficiency in all literature and science, and to Daniel the understanding of all visions and dreams.<br>At the end of the time the king had specified for their preparation, the chief chamberlain brought them before Nebuchadnezzar.<br>When the king had spoken with all of them, none was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and so they entered the king's service.<br>In any question of wisdom or prudence which the king put to them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his kingdom.</p><h3>Book of Daniel</h3><em>3,52.53.54.55.56.</em><p>Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers, <br>praiseworthy and exalted above all forever; <br>and blessed is your holy and glorious name,  <br>praiseworthy and exalted above all for all ages.<br>Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory, <br>praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.<br>Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom, <br>praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.<br>Blessed are you who look into the depths <br>from your throne upon the cherubim; <br>praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.<br>Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven, <br>praiseworthy and glorious forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,1-4.</em><p>When Jesus looked up he saw some wealthy people putting their offerings into the treasury<br>and he noticed a poor widow putting in two small coins.<br>He said, \"I tell you truly, this poor widow put in more than all the rest;<br>for those others have all made offerings from their surplus wealth, but she, from her poverty, has offered her whole livelihood.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Andrew Dung-Lac and His Companions(martyrs (1745-1862) - Memorial)</h3><p>SAINTS ANDREW DUNG-LAC Priest, AND HIS COMPANIONS (18th and 19th centuries) This feast day celebrates the martyrs who laid down their lives in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, from 1745 to 1862. Many of the martyrs were priests of the Dominican order. Others belonged to the Paris Society for Foreign Missions, while still others, including Andrew Dung-Lac, were Vietnamese. Paul Le-Bao-Tinh, a Vietnamese seminarian, wrote a letter shortly before his martyrdom in 1843: \"I, Paul, chained for the name of Christ, wish to tell you the tribulations in which I am immersed every day, so that you, inflamed with love for God, may also lift up your praise to God, 'for his mercy endures forever.' This prison is truly the image of the eternal Hell: to the cruelest tortures of all types, such as fetters, iron chains and bonds, are added hate, vindictiveness, calumny, indecent words, interrogations, bad acts, unjust oaths, curses and finally difficulties and sorrow. But God, who once freed the three boys from the path of the flames, is always with me and has freed me from these tribulations and converted them into sweetness, 'for his mercy endures forever...'\"Assist me with your prayers so that I may struggle according to the law, and indeed 'fight the good fight' and that I may be worthy to fight until the end, finishing my course happily; if we do not see each other again in this life, in the future age, nonetheless, this will be our joy, when standing before the throne of the spotless Lamb, with one voice we sing his praises, exulting in the joy of eternal victory.

Before she was baptized, she saw the Blessed Virgin Mary in a vision. The Mother of God asked Jesus to receive Catherine among God's servants. After being baptized, Catherine had a vision of Jesus welcoming her into heaven. When the tyrant Maximin II came to Alexandria, he was fascinated by Catherine's femininity and wisdom. After a futile pursuit, he became frustrated and enraged. He condemned Catherine to be stripped and scourged. When Catherine fled to the Arabian mountains, soldiers overtook, tortured and killed her. According to tradition, she prayed before dying that no man would see or touch her body. Angels thus carried her remains to a holy grave on Mount Sinai.</p>"},

He was the first to excommunicate Melitius and Arius, the schismatics. He upheld the Apostles Creed and their Traditions, and resisted secular forces and heretical sabotage. St. Peter and his predecessors shielded their flock from persecution. In proclaiming the Gospel, Christians exercised free speech and laid the foundation of Western civilization. Thus, the Church raised up the Western world from the darkness of pagan sacrifice; raising the dignity of man and woman and making them sharers in God's divine life. St. Peter resisted the efforts of heretics to divide the Church. \"Heresy turns the mood against the mind,\" said Chesterton. Arius is perhaps one of the most notable schismatics: He declared that Jesus Christ was a man and not God. In doing so, he predated the teachings of Islam on Jesus' divinity by 300-something years. St. Peter was martyred and united to Jesus in a death like His (Rom 6:5). When we conform ourselves to God by receiving the sacraments, we unite ourselves to Jesus' life. St. Peter is not only the rock of the Church but the steward of Western civilization (Mt 16:18,19).</p><hr /><h3>St. Sylvester(Abbot († 1267))</h3><hr /><p>Saint Sylvester Abbot ( 1267) St. Sylvester was from a patrician family of Osimo, Picenum (modern Ancona, Italy). As a youth, he was conspicuous for his keen intellect and upright conduct. After he was instructed in sacred learning and made a canon, he became an example of piety and disinterested love toward others. At a relative's funeral, when he verified the remains, he was struck by the reality of sin and death. Sylvester went to the desert and conformed himself to Christ. He worked, meditated and performed the norms of piety. He also disciplined his urges through vigils, prayer and fasting. He gave his body a little less than it asked for (St. Jose Maria Escriva). Sylvester sometimes changed his dwelling place to secure his hermitic vocation. At length, he arrived in Monte Fano and built a church in honor of St. Benedict. By doing so, he laid the foundation of the Congregation of Sylvestrines. Sylvester guided monks in regularity and devotions with docility to the Holy Spirit. With authority of his priestly character, he prophesied and exorcised demons. In 1267, he passed away and joined the Church Triumphant in heaven. St. Sylvester nurtured his faith for it to grow. In drawing near to Christ, he encountered the Lord in this way: \"Through a plan of sheer loving goodness, He (God) created us; to communicate Himself to us and make us sharers in His own blessed life\" (CCC 1). Let us emulate St. Sylvester in the norms of piety and daily prayers.</p><hr /><h3>St. Leonard of Port Maurice()</h3><hr /><p></p>"},

While I watched, the wings were plucked; it was raised from the ground to stand on two feet like a man, and given a human mind.<br>The second was like a bear; it was raised up on one side, and among the teeth in its mouth were three tusks. It was given the order, \"Up, devour much flesh.\"<br>After this I looked and saw another beast, like a leopard; on its back were four wings like those of a bird, and it had four heads. To this beast dominion was given.<br>After this, in the visions of the night I saw the fourth beast, different from all the others, terrifying, horrible, and of extraordinary strength; it had great iron teeth with which it devoured and crushed, and what was left it trampled with its feet.<br>I was considering the ten horns it had, when suddenly another, a little horn, sprang out of their midst, and three of the previous horns were torn away to make room for it. This horn had eyes like a man, and a mouth that spoke arrogantly.<br>As I watched, Thrones were set up and the Ancient One took his throne. His clothing was snow bright, and the hair on his head as white as wool; His throne was flames of fire, with wheels of burning fire.<br>A surging stream of fire flowed out from where he sat; Thousands upon thousands were ministering to him, and myriads upon myriads attended him. The court was convened, and the books were opened.<br>I watched, then, from the first of the arrogant words which the horn spoke, until the beast was slain and its body thrown into the fire to be burnt up.<br>The other beasts, which also lost their dominion, were granted a prolongation of life for a time and a season.<br>As the visions during the night continued, I saw One like a son of man coming, on the clouds of heaven; When he reached the Ancient One and was presented before him,<br>He received dominion, glory, and kingship; nations and peoples of every language serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not be taken away, his kingship shall not be destroyed.</p><h3>Book of Daniel</h3><em>3,75.76.77.78.79.80.81.</em><p>Mountains and hills, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Everything growing from the earth, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>You springs, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Seas and rivers, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>You dolphins and all water creatures, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>All you birds of the air, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>All you beasts, wild and tame, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,29-33.</em><p>Jesus told his disciples a parable. “Consider the fig tree and all the other trees.<br>When their buds burst open, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near;<br>in the same way, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near.<br>Amen, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things have taken place.<br>Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. James of the Marches(Franciscan Priest (1394-1476))</h3><p>SAINT JAMES OF THE MARCHES OF ANCONAFranciscan Priest (1394-1476) St. James was born in the small town of Montbrandon, March of Ancona, Italy. As a youth, he was sent to the University of Perugia. There, he soon qualified as a preceptor. He avoided the near occasions of sin and formed virtuous bonds. While travelling near Assisium, he went into the great Church of the Portiuncula to pray. Upon seeing the spirit of fervor that animated St. Francis' brothers, he petitioned for their habit. He transcended disordered desires through prayer, fasting and visits to the Holy Eucharist. As a Franciscan, James declined the Archbishopic of Milan. The luxuries and priviledges of the see contradicted his ideals of spiritual poverty and obedience. Nevertheless, he wrought several miracles in Venice and elsewhere. He also cured the Duke of Calabria and the King of Naples from dangerous illnesses. James passed away at the convent of the Holy Trinity, near Naples, on November 28, 1476. He was 90 years old and had served the Church as a religious for seventy years.</p>"},

They shall be handed over to him for a year, two years, and a half-year.<br>But when the court is convened, and his power is taken away by final and absolute destruction,<br>Then the kingship and dominion and majesty of all the kingdoms under the heavens shall be given to the holy people of the Most High, Whose kingdom shall be everlasting: all dominions shall serve and obey him.\"</p><h3>Book of Daniel</h3><em>3,82.83.84.85.86.87.</em><p>You sons of men, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>O Israel, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Priests of the Lord, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Servants of the Lord, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Spirits and souls of the just, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.<br>Holy men of humble heart, bless the Lord; <br>praise and exalt him above all forever.</p><h3>Holy Gospel of Jesus Christ according to Saint Luke</h3><em>21,34-36.</em><p>Jesus said to his disciples: \"Beware that your hearts do not become drowsy from carousing and drunkenness and the anxieties of daily life, and that day catch you by surprise<br>like a trap. For that day will assault everyone who lives on the face of the earth.<br>Be vigilant at all times and pray that you have the strength to escape the tribulations that are imminent and to stand before the Son of Man.\"</p><hr /><h3>St. Saturninus(Bishop and Martyr († 250))</h3><p>SAINT SATURNINUS Bishop and Martyr ( 250) St. Saturninus preached in Gaul around 245 by direction of Pope Fabian. He established an episcopal see in Toulouse and became the first Christian bishop of that city. Although few Christians lived there, their numbers swelled rapidly after his arrival. In retaliation, the devil, who receives pagan worship and claims self-sufficiency from God, incited the hard of heart to kill the Saint. One day, when Bp. Saturninus was passing by a pagan temple on his way to church, a crowd detained him and goaded him to sacrifice a bull. Bp. Saturninus refused and instead praised Jesus Christ, the One True God. Upon hearing this, a lynch mob fastened him to the bull and drove it down the capitol. After his martyrdom, St. Saturninus' destroyed body was dignified and buried by two devout women. The seeds of Western civilization were sown through the shedding of his blood. He lives forever with Christ and intercedes in related causes.</p>"},

His younger brother was perhaps St. Peter. St. Andrew was also a disciple of John the Baptist. One of St. Andrew's traits was bringing others to notice. When he was called by Christ on the banks of the Jordan, his first act was to search for his brother. \"We have found the Messiah,\" he told St. Peter. It was also St. Andrew who pointed out the boy with five loaves and fishes before Christ fed five thousand in the desert. St. Andrew went to plant the faith in Scythia and Greece, where he gained a martyr's crown. He was scourged in Patræ, Achaia, before being crucified.For two days, he preached and glorified God before dying on the cross. He continues drawing souls to Christ as an intercessor and a mirror of God.</p><hr /><h3>St. Maura()</h3><hr />"}]
